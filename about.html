    <h1>A brief intro</h1>

    <p>Sesowi is meant to be the simplest possible language to learn, that is nonetheless fully capable of expressing any idea. It rides on the principles of <em>simplicity</em> and <em>neutrality</em>: not only is it easy to learn (<em>simplicity</em>), but it is easy to learn for speakers of all languages, and doesn't give an advantage to people with a particular native language (<em>neutrality/universality</em>).</p>

    <p><strong>Wait, Hasn’t this been tried before?</strong> There have been a variety of attempted IALs (International Auxiliary Languages) over the years, most famously Esperanto. However, these all do not satisfy the basic criteria of <em>universalty</em> and <em>neutrality</em>. Well known IALs include <em>Esperanto</em>, <em>Volapük</em>, <em>Interlingua</em>, <em>Interlingue</em>, <em>Ido</em>, <em>Novial</em>, <em>Lingua Franca Nova</em>, and <em>Idiom Neutral</em>, all of which are essentially simplified versions of Latin. They have their own beauty, but they are far from universal. Even ones attempting to be more global, like <em>Lingwa di Planeta</em>, still have a fundamentally Indo-European phonology and structure. And <em>Lojban</em> is explicitly stated to be impossible to learn perfectly. All of these leave non European speakers — namely the majority of the world — at a heavy social disadvantage. Sesowi is a more global middle ground, positioned somewhere between Indo-European and Sinitic languages, with influence from Dravidian languages.</p>

    <p><strong>A basic test of neutrality: A Mandarin Chinese speaker, an American English speaker, and a Mexican Spanish speaker all learn a language. After three months, are they all at about the same skill level?</strong> For all of the above languages, the answer is clearly: no. The Chinese speaker would have much worse proficiency. Simply from the experience of this one hypothetical Chinese person, we can pull up some simple tests that all these languages fail:</p>
    
    <ul>
        <li>A universal language should not have consonant clusters (like E<strong>sp</strong>eranto, Inte<strong>rl</strong>ingua, <strong>Pl</strong>aneta)</li>
        <li>A universal language should not have final consonants except nasals (like Volapü<strong>k</strong>, Novia<strong>l</strong>, Neutra<strong>l</strong>)</li>
        <li>A universal language should not have tricky or rare consonants like &lt;rfvzhj&gt; (like Espe<strong>r</strong>anto, No<strong>v</strong>ia, Neut<strong>r</strong>al)</li>
        <li>A universal language should not have tricky grammar quirks like case systems, subjunctive/conditional, adjective agreements, gendered pronouns etc.</li>
        <li>...</li>
    </ul>

    <p>These languages claim to be universal but distinguishes between he/him/she/her? That's four pronouns where only one is needed, and only one is used in most major non-Indo-European languages (Chinese, Hindi, Turkish, Bengali, Indonesian....)</p>

    <p>There is, however, one language that does satisfy all these criteria, and very well at that: Toki Pona. Toki pona is a work of art done by someone with a deep and universal understanding of languages. However, it has no intention of being an IAL. The goal of Toki Pona is more personal discovery than communication, and more complex or exact topics, like numbers above five, are difficult to express.</p>

    <p>Sesowi grammar is uninflecting and relies on word order and part-of-speech markers. It does away with any grammatical element that is not deemed necessary for communication, e.g. tenses, moods like the conditional, animacy, case systems, and gender. It is phonologically simple, lacking tricky elements like consonant clusters, rhotics, or final consonants (except /ŋ/). Needless to say, there are no grammatical exceptions, or nonsense around spelling.</p>

    <p>Much of the beauty of Sesowi is in its lexicon. Sesowi words themselves are more like a vague cloud of meaning, having a wide range of meanings, and a single word is often not clear without context.<sup><a href="#fn:1" id="fnref:1">1</a></sup> Importantly,<sup><a href="#fn:2" id="fnref:2">2</a></sup> these words do not have a specific part of speech, functioning as verb, noun, or adjective depending on grammatical role. There are only a few hundred of these atoms, but the language makes extensive use of compounding to make more complex concepts.</p>

    <p>Sesowi eschews the complex ontologies common in natural languages, in favor of context and pragmatics. To observe this, let us demonstrate how many different sub-classes of words natural languages have — sub-classes that are logically organized but nonetheless not necessary.<sup><a href="#fn:3" id="fnref:3">3</a></sup> We will illustrate this by comparison to another natural language that lacks many of these sub-classes: the English pidgin dialect Cronch, spoken by a small community in Central California.</p>

    <div class="table-container">

        </table>
    </div>

    <p>In these examples, Cronch, like Sesowi, uses a single word for each concept, even though the meaning of this word is quite different in each context. For instance, “stress” means either “experiencing stress” or “causing stress”. Nonetheless, the meaning is unambiguous in context, and the “correct” word in standard English does not add to comprehension.</p>

    <p>Natural languages usually have such complex ontologies of different types of concepts, and each one is treated differently. Adjectives are neatly bundled into causal adjectives (“stressful”), stateful adjectives (“stressed”) and so on; verbs are marked as to whether they are being performed, have been performed, are intransitive, and so on. However, this logical ontology, which is so natural to the human mind, is not usually necessary, given context! And for a learner, it is just extra burden.</p>

    <p>Languages are already full of pragmatic meaning that can only be derived from context, but Sesowi opines that they half-ass their pragmatics. Sesowi fully asses its pragmatics.</p>

    <h1>Another brief intro</h1>

    <p>Sesowi is a creole language that evolved in the early 2090s in Nigeria as a trade language, largely between the two largest languages of that country, namely Naijá and Mandarin. However, since the port of Lagos is the largest single hub in the global shipping market, it naturally draws influences from other common languages used by maritime traders, like Spanish, Telugu, and Ilocano. The phonology of this language is more or less that of Naijá, though consonant clusters and finals have been dropped along with the voiced fricatives and affricates from contact with Chinese, and [f] has been dropped from Philippine languages.</p>

    <p>As is common to creole languages, Sesowi has a relatively small core vocabulary, of only around 200 words. However, its Chinese substratum leads to two interesting results: first, like Chinese, it extensively makes use of compounding, to form many longer words; and second, the core words in Sesowi are all exactly one syllable. Despite these two similarities to Chinese, however, the effect ends up being quite different – unlike Chinese, the core vocabulary is very small, so Sesowi words / sentences tend to be more syllables than Chinese; but since it lacks the extensive use of affricates and triphthongs from Chinese, each syllable is much faster to say. The result is something like Greek — a barrage of quickly uttered syllables.</p>

    <p>Like its parents, Sesowi has no inflections, and does not differentiate gender or animacy (so he/she/it/this are all the same). In common with Dravidian languages, Sesowi does not differentiate between tenses and modal verbs.</p>

    <p>Sesowi has no adjectives; similar to Tok Pisin, it forms them entirely with relative clauses. In fact, according to a strict interpretation, Sesowi has no parts of speech except for nouns and quantifiers. According to a looser interpretation, it has two prepositions, a handful of modal verbs, and a special verb to introduce relative clauses.</p>

    <h1>Principles of Sesowi</h1>

    <ol>
        <li>Sesowi should be as easy as possible to learn</li>
        <li>Sesowi should be equally easy for people of distinct backgrounds
            <ol type="a">
                <li>e.g. an English speaker, a Spanish speaker, and a Chinese speaker should have accents of the same strength</li>
            </ol>
        </li>
        <li>Sesowi should be fun, and learning it should bring joy</li>
    </ol>
    
    <div class="principle-block">
        <span class="principle">principle of similar proficiency</span>
        <p>Speakers should have similar proficiency, regardless of their background, so one group does not have an unfair advantage.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Applied to phonology, this means that no one group should have a much stronger accent than another. For instance, the consonant clusters, rhotics, and final consonants in conlangs like Esperanto would make it so that Vietnamese and Chinese speakers would have strong accents, but Spaniards would have little or no accent. (Esperanto, Volapük, Ido, interlingua, interlingue, and lojban all fail at this). Note: Lojban has a consonant cluster in every verb, eg “<strong>cidjrspageti</strong>”, suggesting that although they believed they drew from Chinese words, they did not have a Chinese linguist on their team.</li>
        </ul>
    </div>
    
    <div class="principle-block">
        <span class="principle">principle of low confusability</span>
        <p>When speaking this language, a given word should be as hard to confuse as possible.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Applied to phonology: remove any sounds or words that are easily mistaken. For instance, Hindi, Spanish, Chinese, and Telugu (and more) speakers have trouble differentiating v and w. So remove them both. Similarly, don’t include both /e/ and /ei/, as American speakers will have trouble telling them apart. Omit all homophones. For classes of similar words, make them especially hard to confuse – for instance, numbers and tenses. The English fifty/fifteen is entirely unacceptable. Spanish canto/cantó is also pretty egregious.</li>
        </ul>
    </div>

    <div class="principle-block">
        <span class="principle">principle of some delight</span>
        <p>Learning and mastering this language should cause delight, even at the expense of small amounts of added complexity. Overall, people will learn a language much better if they are motivated to! Were the language purely dry, why would anyone want to learn it? It should be a pull to people who don’t NEED it.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="principle-block">
        <span class="principle">Principle of reducing memorization</span>
        <p>Compounds introduce complexity because they require memorization. Therefore, whenever possible, we should rely on generative processes to express concepts. This has the downside that it becomes harder to express subtleties of meaning, but we can make up for this with a well-developed and well-decomposed system of modification (adjectives etc.) Using this principle, a word like <strong>sprint</strong> should probably be expressed as <strong>run very-fast</strong> or similar, rather than having its own bespoke word. We lose the additional connotations, but they are subtle enough that we probably don’t lse very much. But what about a word like <strong>run</strong> ? Is running different enough from walking that it should get its own word, or is it just <strong>walk fast</strong>? And is <strong>walking</strong> different enough from <strong>going</strong> that it should be <strong>go footly</strong> or should going and walking be the same (as in German)? These are trickier cases, especially that of running, but I would bias towards adjectival phrases.</p>
    </div>
    
    <div class="principle-block">
        <span class="subprinciple">subprinciple of no redundancy</span>
        <p>every element of a sentence should add information. No element should be required by grammar if it does not add meaning. Consider a sentence like “les chiennes rouges sont allées”. All of these endings do not add meaning, but are required. As a result, their only function is to make it harder to master the language.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="principle-block">
        <span class="subsubprinciple">subsubprinciple of some redundancy to make things easier</span>
        <p>When something can be inferred from contexts, most natural languages opt for economy and omit extra words. For instance, Chinese does away with the 了 when the past tense is implied by “yesterday”, and Indonesian does the same, implying all tenses. This makes the language fractionally faster to speak, but noticeably harder to learn. Therefore, the present language opts for some redundancy. For instance, all three tenses are marked with a modal, whereas most natural languages would make one of these the default – for instance Nigerian Pidgin, where omitting the “dey” makes it past tense.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="principle-block">
        <span class="subprinciple">subprinciple of The more similar they are, the more different they should be</span>
        <p>It’s ok for two words to sound similar. But if they also mean similar things, then this is a recipe for confusion! For instance, when learning Mandarin I would constantly mix up lǜ (green) and lán (blue). These don’t even sound very similar! But they both start in /l/ and a dark vowel, and it was (and tbh is) quite confusing for me. Similarly, the basic numbers liù (6) and jiǔ (9) are still confusing to me, even though the don’t sound that similar – but they both end in -iu. English is no better,<sup><a href="#fn:4" id="fnref:4">4</a></sup> with “fifty” versus “fifteen”, and “can” vs. “can’t”. The conclusion is that words that have similar meanings, e.g. colors, numbers, animals, etc., should also sound as different as possible. This is somewhat unintuitive, because one might have the intuition that similar things should sound similar! But this leads to confusion.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="principle-block">
        <span class="subprinciple">subprinciple of contextual unambiguity</span>
        <p>In a given context, a word should have an unambiguous meaning.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="principle-block">
        <span class="subprinciple">subprinciple of cross-contextual sharing</span>
        <p>Across contexts, the same word can mean many different things! For instance, in English, a person has skin, a tree has bark, cheese has a rind, bread has crust, and a dirt pond has a film. These should all just be “skin”. (or surface?).</p>
    </div>

    <div class="principle-block">
        <span class="subprinciple">subprinciple of quickest understanding</span>
        <p>the speaker should be able to tell what a sentence is about as soon as possible. In other words, be the opposite of German verbs.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Applied to grammar, this means that you want to hear “Subject Verb Object” as soon as possible. Therefore, the adjectives and adverbs should come after the headword, as in Spanish, not before, as in English.</li>
            <li>consider “I saw the big, red, alarmingly happy dog” or</li>
        </ul>
    </div>

    <div class="principle-block">
        <span class="subprinciple">subprinciple of ease of typing</span>
        <p>this language should be easy to type on any keyboard, and shouldn’t use weird characters like periods as letters. Therefore, omit all diacritics. (Esperanto, Volüpak, ido, interlingua, interlingue, and lojban all fail at this).</p>

    Each Sesowi syllable has the form CV[N], where C is a consonant, V is a vowel, and N is the sound “ng”.
    <h4>Vowels</h4>
    Sesowi has the five cardinal vowels <b>/aiuoe/</b>, as well as three diphthongs <b>/ai/</b>,<b>/au/</b>, and <b>/oi/</b>, which are pronounced exactly like the combination of the two vowels they are made of.
    <h4>Consonants</h4>
    Sesowi has 12 simple consonants, <b>/w/</b>,<b>/y/</b>,<b>/m/</b>,<b>/b/</b>,<b>/g/</b>,<b>/d/</b>,<b>/n/</b>,<b>/s/</b>,<b>/p/</b>,<b>/k/</b>,<b>/t/</b>,<b>/l/</b> and 11 compound consonants, <b>/ny/</b>,<b>/mw/</b>,<b>/bw/</b>,<b>/gw/</b>,<b>/dw/</b>,<b>/sw/</b>,<b>/pw/</b>,<b>/kw/</b>,<b>/tw/</b>. The compound consonants are pronounced exactly like the combination of their two constituents, e.g. /<b>k</b>ik/ sounds like “<b>k</b>ick” and /<b>kw</b>ik/ sounds like “<b>qu</b>ick”.
    <h4>Phonotactics</h4>
    A variety of possible syllables are never used by Sesowi, as they are deemed too easy to mistake with other syllables. For example, <span class="wrong">*nyi</span> and <span class="wrong">*yi</span> are too easy to mistake for <span class="surface">ni</span> and <span class="surface">i</span>, respectively. Diphthongs plus nasal coda, like <span class="wrong">*bwaing</span> or <span class="wrong">*saung</span>, are forbidden as they are deemed too hard to pronounce.

    According to phoible, here is a list of the world’s phonemes from most to least common, keeping in mind that this is over almost 3000 languages, so Papua new Guinea will have a disproportionate representation: m k j p w n t l s b ŋ ɡ h d r f ɲ t̠ʃ ʔ ʃ z d̠ʒ v ɾ t̪ ts kʰ pʰ x n̪ ʈ ʒ ɣ d̪ c tʰ ɳ ȵ ɡb kp kʷ ɟ ɭ ȶ dz β ɻ ɓ mb nd

    “Bybee explained that the proposed primal consonants come from five sets: the consonants are: the stops made with full closure of the lips (labials), /p b m/; stops made with the tongue creating closure at the teeth or behind the teeth, /t d n/; stops made with the back of the tongue against the soft palate, /k g ŋ/; and fricative /s/ and lateral /l/
    <br/>
    “Almost all languages use consonants from these five sets to make words,” she said. “Research on 81 unrelated languages identified sound changes that this small set of consonants undergoes to create new consonants… By contrast, it is very rare for consonants not included in the primal consonant set to change into one of the primal consonants. The discovery of these primal consonants is a major contribution to our understanding of the origins of human language.”

    Voicing contrast? [b] [d] [g] vs [p] [t] [k]
    Please note that what actually matters is the contrasts, not the phonemes themselves. For instance, /b/, /p/, and /pʰ/ are common phonemes. But very few languages contrast all three. In fact, not one of the world’s five most spoken languages has the same set of contrasts:
    <ul>
      <li>English contrasts /b/ and /pʰ/</li>
      <li>Mandarin contrasts /p/, and /pʰ/</li>
      <li>Hindi has all of /b/, /p/, and /pʰ/</li>
      <li>Spanish contrasts /b/ and /p/</li>
      <li>Arabic has no contrast, and uses only /b/</li>
    </ul>
    
    For Sesowi, we have chosen to contrast the two most distinguishable of these three, namely  /b/ and /pʰ/, as English does. This minimizes the possibility of confusion. The same goes for /d/ vs /tʰ/ and  /g/ vs /kʰ/
    
    
    Most of the world’s languages contrast voiced and voiceless stops, including Chinese, all Indo-European languages, and indeed all of the top 30 most spoken languages except Tamil – with the exception that Arabic varieties usually don’t contrast [p]/[b]. Toki Pona lacks this contrast. The one wrinkle is that DFSDFVS

    Many languages lack a v/w distinction, including Mandarin, all Indian languages, and (sort of) German. Thus, clearly only one of these should be included! Some languages, like Spanish, also lack a b/v distinction. These two constraints together lead us to include [b] and [w], but not [v].

    Arabic lacks [tʃ]. Most Spanish varieties lack [dʒ], or when they do have it, don't contrast it with [j]; similarly, most Slavic languages have [tʃ] (well, [t͡ɕ]) but lacks [dʒ].

    <div class="section-h3"><div class="collapsible-header">On rhotics</div><div class="collapsible-content">
    
    Most languages have rhotics. However, they are frequently very different from each other. Consider the "strong rhotics"  /ɹ/, /r/, /ʁ/, /ʐ/, and /ɻ/, from English, Spanish, French, Mandarin, and Tamil. Each one of these sounds is exceedingly difficult for speakers of any of the other four to make. Therefore, including any of them in the language would be unwise; and allowing for all would be chaos.
    
    On the other hand, the "weak rhotic" /ɾ/ is a much easier sound to deal with. English, Mandarin, and French lack it, and Japanese does not contrast it with /l/, but Spanish, Portuguese, Arabic, Turkish, and all Indian languages have it (sometimes in free variation with /r/). English even has the sound as an allophone of /t/, and it is not a hard sound to master. Nonetheless, it will be an accent-marking phoneme, at least for English, Mandarin, French, and Japanese, who will tend to realize it as their strong rhotic. There is a strong argument for including it (also because rhotics are great), but for the purpose of reducing accent marking, maybe best to exclude.

    wikipedia: "Labialization is the most widespread secondary articulation in the world's languages. It is phonemically contrastive in Northwest Caucasian (e.g. Adyghe), Athabaskan, and Salishan language families, among others. This contrast is reconstructed also for Proto-Indo-European, the common ancestor of the Indo-European languages; and it survives in Latin and some Romance languages. It is also found in the Cushitic and Ethio-Semitic languages.
    
    American English labializes /r, ʃ, ʒ, tʃ, dʒ/ to various degrees.[citation needed]
    
    A few languages, including Arrernte and Mba, have contrastive labialized forms for almost all of their consonants.
    
    In many Salishan languages, such as Klallam, velar consonants only occur in their labialized forms (except /k/, which occurs in some loanwords). However, uvular consonants occur abundantly labialized and unrounded."

    <div class="section-h2"><div class="collapsible-header">Syllables</div><div class="collapsible-content">
    
    All syllables are CV[N], where the final consonant can only be the velar nasal <ng>. A small set of function words can also be vowel-initial
    
    
    </div></div>
    
    <div class="section-h2"><div class="collapsible-header">Nasal coda</div><div class="collapsible-content">
    
    Final consonants are hard to say and evolve away in general. However, nasal codas (final consonants that are nasal) tend to remain. But which of the nasals, and how many, should remain?
    
    <ol>
      <li>There are four obvious choices for a final nasal: m, n, and ng. All other nasals are more obscure.</li>
      <li>Only 1 nasal should be a coda. For instance, in Mandarin, there are two (n and ng), and they are actually pretty tricky to distinguish as a non-native speaker.
        <ol type="a">
          <li>Another motivation for only one nasal coda: Nasals tend to assimilate. Meaning: all of bam-ka, ban-ka, and bang-ka will tend to end up being realized as bang-ka.</li>
        </ol>
      </li>
      <li>One problem with final consonants (in a language without geminates) is that if the next syllable starts in the same syllable, you might end up with homonyms, which we don’t want. For instance, bam-mi and ba-mi would sound the same. Therefore, ideally, the nasal coda would not occur in syllable-initial position.</li>
      <li>Even if the nasal coda does not occur in the initial position, it may still assimilate into initial nasals. For instance, ban-mi would likely be pronounced as bam-mi. however, this is less likely to happen between the bilabial nasal and the velar nasal. For instance, in English, "Fan me" goes to "fammi", but "sing me" does not assimilate.</li>
    </ol>
    
    Given that we want /m/ to be a possible initial nasal, there is only one nasal that satisfies these requirements: /ŋ/.
    
    How should this be written? There are four options, none perfect:
    
    <ol>
      <li>Use the conventional digraph ⟨ng⟩.
        <ol type="a">
          <li>Pro: used by Euro languages, Pinyin, and Austronesian languages.</li>
          <li>Con: is a digraph; breaks the 1-letter-1-sound rule</li>
        </ol>
      </li>
      <li>Use an unused letter, like ⟨q⟩.
        <ol type="a">
          <li>Con: not intuitively easy to read</li>
        </ol>
      </li>
      <li>Use ⟨n⟩, but know that it is pronounced as ŋ when at the end of a syllable
        <ol type="a">
          <li>Con: breaks 1-letter-1-sound rule</li>
        </ol>
      </li>
      <li>Use the IPA symbol ⟨ŋ⟩.
        <ol type="a">
          <li>Con: it is hard to type on most keyboards.</li>
        </ol>
      </li>
    </ol>
    
    I have ordered these from best to worst. Curse you Latin Script, for not giving us an easier letter.
    
    Final note: I was just listening to a Mandarin speaker speaking English, and saying things like “pingpoint the problem” and “cleang the data“

    <div class="section-h2"><div class="collapsible-header">Allophones</div><div class="collapsible-content">
    
    Ideally, there are no allophones, since they will tend to make a language harder to learn and understand. However, there may be some that are introduced by speakers. Possible ones I foresee:
    <ol>
      <li>/t/ and /d/ flapping before an unstressed syllable, as in English and Indian languages</li>
      <li>nasal coda assimilating into next consonant
        <ol type="a">
          <li>nasal coda assimilating into following nasal</li>
        </ol>
      </li>
      <li>initial /w/ before a front vowel changing to /v/</li>
      <li>plosives following nasal coda becoming implosive</li>
    </ol>
    
    Of these, (1) and (2a) are concerns. I would love it if (4) happens…
    Orthography
    
    
    As in English, but eliminating all conjunct consonants. There is a 1:1 correspondence between single letters and sounds. Hence:  “x” for “sh”, “c” for “ch”.
