"or/"and:" is messed up. Either "lai" is "other/or", and ?? is "also", or "lai" is "other/and" and ?? os "or". (nolai? laino?)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

some glosses are not being emphed, e.g.

<span class="gloss-emph">flat-thing</span></td>

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

decide: do i/a unambiguously singularize, e.g. zh zhege, or not, e.g. id toko-ini?

decide: does swa for emphasis come before or after?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

still need to decide on whether to make the plural marker a suffix. It's against the Sesowi logic, but better matches ALL the major languages.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

fix how this is looking up the gloss
<li>gloss: <span class="gloss">me back do see cat like dark-color</span></li>


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

fix how styes are inherited in about.html -- principles div seems not to be used
make tests tab do more things, like read i dictionary
rename window.compounds ot window.compound_gloss_to_supercompound (check this)
rename io.js to typing_tools.js

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

write a script to process all tutorial_part_* and output a single text file called "tutorial_combined.txt". The processing that needs to be done is:
  1. for any word in the "gloss" class span, look it up in the trevorese dictionary and replace it with the surface form
  2. remove all <span class="xx">, <b>, </b>, <i>, </i> tags
  3. convert tables to bullet lists by putting each <td> on its own line, with the anem fo the relevant column preceding the <td> content 

Example input:

<div class="table-container"><table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>en</th>
<th>gloss</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>This is <b>mine</b></td>
<td><span class="gloss">this</span> <span class="gloss">do</span> <span class="gloss">be</span> <span class="gloss-emph">of</span> <span class="gloss-emph">me</span></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>This is <b>my</b> cat. Where is <b>yours?</b></td>
<td><span class="gloss">this</span> <span class="gloss">cat</span> <span class="gloss">do</span> <span class="gloss">be</span> <span class="gloss-emph">of</span> <span class="gloss-emph">me</span>. <span class="gloss-emph">of</span> <span class="gloss-emph">you</span> <span class="gloss">what</span> <span class="gloss">place</span>?</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table></div>

output:
  * en: This is mine
  * gloss: i du bi de mi
  * en: This is my cat. Where is yours?
  * gloss:i du bi mau de mi. de yu du bi e lu?


This will be a new javascript file, and will rely on the existing fucntions and window variables in e.g. general.js. For context on how to do this, read ../technical_documentation.md. When the script is ready, tell me how to run it.





YAKSHAVING:
  - write better machine readable stories and compounds (everything in surface form, no divs?)
  - fix stories and tutorial to remove bad compounds and glosses
  - output tvr:en as nice text dictionary, organized sa each atom (by complexity) followed by all compounds ending in it. 
# maybe make the stories follow the same set of characters??

"""Here is a description of the Trevorese language and grammar:

{full_tutorial}

Here is the full dictionary of Trevorese words and definitions:

{full_dictionary}

Here are some example stories written in Trevorese:

{stories}

Now, you are going to make a outlines of lessons for learning Trevorese. Each lesson introduces 10-20 vocab words, 1-2 grammar points, and has a story using those words and grammar.

Each lesson should be output in the following json format:
{{
  "new_atoms": 2-6 new atoms to introduce to the user.
  "new_atom_compounds": For every new atom, introduce 1-2 new compounds using it.
  "old_atom_compounds": 4-8 new compounds composed of previous atoms
  "grammar_points": 1-2 grammar points that will be covered this lesson. Lessons near the end may not have any 
  "story_plot": a sentence summarizing the plot of the story for this section The story will be 1-3 paragraphs, and will be made later.
}}


For earlier lessons you will likely need to introduce more atoms and fewer compounds; as the lessons progress you may just introduce 2 atoms a lesson and many more compounds. For earlier lessons most of the compounds will be in the new_compounds section, and there may be very few review_compounds.  All compounds should only use atoms from this lesson or previous lessons.

remember that in the first few lessons, the learner won't have enough vocabulary for a real "story" per se.

Example output:

{EXAMPLE_SCHEMA}

Now, output a list of the first 100 lessons in Trevorese:
"""







----------
For each schema, look up the full definition of each word, and give it as a super-schema, along with the entire tutorial + stories, and all the previous super schemata. Note that ths construction (2-step generation; full_dictionary only available in first pass) prevents usage of unknown words as the model has no access to them (except for from examples and tutorial):

def get_super_schema(schema):
  schema["fulldefs"] = []
  for vocab in schema["new_atoms"] + schema["new_atom_compounds"] + schema["old_atom_compounds"]:
     schema["fulldefs"].append(get_fulldef(vocab))
  return str(super_schema)
  

"""Here is a description of the Trevorese language and grammar:

{full_tutorial}

Here are some example stories written in Trevorese:

{stories}

Now, you will write stories for a curriculum, for lesson #{i}.
Here are the summaries of the lessons so far:

{all_previous_super_schemata}

Here is the schema for the current lesson:

{super_schema}

Now, write a 1-2 paragraph story on the given topic. Use each new vocab word and grammar point at least once. Output as a json with format:

{{
    "text": [list of sentences, with empty string for paragraph boundary],
    "translation": [English translations of each sentence in the "text" list]
}}
