              <p><strong>Comparative Linguist's corner:</strong> this formation of questions is extremely common across the world's languages, from Singlish (ma) to Japanese („Åã), although it is not always the final position, as in Turkish "mi", which follows the predicate. Even English has this to some degree, e.g. "you're a bit big for this now, eh?".</p>

              <p>As in most languages, you can leave off the "you"/ <span class="gloss">you</span> for a command:</p>

            <p>This <span class="gloss">what</span> that we have been using to form questions is what is called (in Sesowi grammar) a quantifier. Quantifiers are little words that tell us something about the way that an object exists. They come before the noun. The quantifiers we have seen so far are <span class="gloss">this</span>, <span class="gloss">that</span>, <span class="gloss">what</span>, <span class="gloss">number</span>, <span class="gloss">no</span>, and numbers, like <span class="gloss">one</span> or 67.</p>

              <p>There is one more of these fundamental quantifiers, namely <span class="gloss">all</span>, meaning <span class="english">all/every/each</span> or <span class="english">complete</span>:</p>

              <p>Two more words that fall in this category in English are <span class="english">some</span> and <span class="english">any</span>. For the most part these are entirely unnecessary in Sesowi:</p>

              <p>Look closely at these. In English, we have so many different words for these concepts, and it hides how similar they all are! It is common for a language to be like English in this way, and have some collection of concepts from different roots and languages, such that the true structure is hidden. However, several other languages actually make these relations perfectly clear ‚Äî for instance Telugu, what uses exactly the structure described above!</p>

              <p>In English, these comparisons use all sorts of different structures and prepositions to express these concepts. But Sesowi treats them all the same way: simple comparisons with <span class="gloss">direction</span>.</p>

              <p>We have seen how to use a verb with a noun as its object:<br />

                  Now let's talk about verbs that act on other verbs, which we can call "modal verbs":<br />
                  <b>modal verb:</b> <span class="english">I can sing</span> (the object of the <i>modal verb</i> <span class="english">can</span> is the <i>verb</i><span class="english">sing,</span>)
              </p>
              <p>The most common verbs that act on other verbs are a set of five or so verbs that actually can ONLY<sup><a href="#fn:1" id="fnref:1">1</a></sup> take verbs as objects. For instance, <span class="english">I can sing</span> works, but <span class="english">I can the cat</span> has no meaning.

              <p>Verbs that act on other verbs are incredibly powerful, and capture all the different ways you can perform a noun ‚Äì including tense! When we told you about tenses before, we only told you half the story. What we didn't tell you is that the two tense markers we taught you ‚Äî <span class="gloss">back</span> and <span class="gloss">front</span> ‚Äî are in fact themselves just a special case of verbs acting on verbs.

              <p>All these constructions are all formed the same way! And indeed, in Sesowi, there is no difference between "tenses" and "modal verbs". The concept of a "tense" as it is usually conceived is based on how Indo-European languages work, where tenses are treated in a special way, but modals are treated more like verbs. However, in other languages, it's not so. In Chinese, Vietnamese, or Malay, tenses are expressed as adverbs, and in Telugu, tenses and modals are in the same category of suffixes!</p>

              <p>Reminder: every verb has exactly one <span class="gloss">do</span>. It sticks to the main verb like a prefix, and other things, like modals or tenses, line up before it without a <span class="gloss">do</span> of their own.</p>

              <p>However, you can also add a second object with a preposition like <b>to</b> or <b>at.</b> This second object is called the indirect object. Just as English, Sesowi marks these with the preposition "to" (aka <span class="gloss">direction</span>)</p>

              <p>When speaking, we need some way to differentiate between these two objects. For example, "give me to the girl" and "give me the girl" are very different sentences. To an English speaker, this should be pretty straightforward: you just indicate the recipient of the verb phrase with <span class="gloss">direction</span>. Why is it worth mentioning? First of all, other languages treat indirect objects differently (e.g. with the Dative case). Second of all, English has another way of marking the indirect object, just by using the word order:</p>

              <p>In Sesowi, you can never omit the preposition <span class="gloss">direction</span> for the indirect object.</p>
              <p>There are a few verbs in English that use "to" even when it appears to be a direct object. For instance, you talk <b>to someone</b>. However, in these cases this is because there is an implied indirect object: when you talk to someone, you are actually saying words (the direct object) to someone (the indirect object). The situation is the same for Sesowi: for these verbs with implied objects, we use the preposition <span class="gloss">direction</span>:</p>

              <p>This point should not pose problems for speakers of English: they should just translate "to" into <span class="gloss">direction</span>. This should be familiar also to speakers of Chinese, where <span class="gloss">direction</span> can be interpreted as ÂØπ: one can see that above, the treatment of <span class="english">to talk</span> is the same as Chinese ËØ¥ vs ËØ¥ÂØπ.</p>
              <p>Note 1: In Chinese, there is the exact same phenomenon, where if there is no particle, the first object is the indirect object and the second is direct (I give you a thing / ÊàëÁªô‰Ω†‰∏Ä‰∏™‰∏úË•ø). if you invert the order of the objects but want the same meaning, you need to add a particle (I give a thing <b>to</b> you / Êàë<b>Êää</b>‰∏Ä‰∏™‰∏úË•øÁªô‰Ω†). However, instead of marking the indirect object, Chinese marks the direct object.</p>
              <p>Note 2: Interestingly, in English there are also verbs where you are not allowed to use the word order, and you have to use a preposition. Consider the word <span class="english">say.</span> While you can say <span class="english">Give me the cat</span>, you can't say <span class="wrong">*Say me the thing</span>.</p>

          <div class="collapsible-content">
              <p>In Indo-European languages like English, verbs have a special form called the infinitive, which is used in certain situations when there isn't a subject doing the verb. In English, you can often use the gerund (-ing form) in similar ways.</p>
              <p>Many situations where IE languages use the infinitive is when you have a verb acting on another verb. We already saw how to do this:</p>
              <div class="table-container">
                  <table>

              </div>

              <p>Another situation where IE languages use an infinitive or gerund is when you are referring to the general state of a verb, as in "walking is good" or "It is good to walk." In this case, the verb has become a sort of noun, meaning "the state of walking". In Sesowi, we just need to add the "do" to show that it is a verb, and then you can use it like any other noun:</p>

              <p>Serendipitously, this ends up sounding similar to the English construction "to Verb"!</p>
              <p>Finally, there are situations in English where gerunds like <span class="english">being</span> pop up just because English uses "to be" for adjectives as well:</p>

          <div class="collapsible-content">

                                <p>The most basic way to make two clauses in Sesowi is to just put two sentences one after the other:</p>
<div class="table-container"><table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>en</th>
<th>gloss</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>I told you</td>
<td><span class="gloss">me</span> <span class="gloss">back</span> <span class="gloss">do</span> <span class="gloss">talk</span> <span class="gloss">direction</span> <span class="gloss">you</span></td>

<tr>
<td>I told you (that) the cat broke a cup</td>
<td><span class="gloss">me</span> <span class="gloss">back</span> <span class="gloss">do</span> <span class="gloss">talk</span> <span class="gloss">direction</span> <span class="gloss">you</span>, <span class="gloss">cat</span> <span class="gloss">do</span> <span class="gloss">break</span> <span class="gloss">water-container</span> </td>

In English, we can optionally put a "that" in there to make the causality clear. In Sesowi, as in Chinese, there is no such word and you just put the clauses next to each other.

<br>

Of course, you can also use conjunctions to connect two clauses:

<div class="table-container"><table>

<div class="section-h3"><div class="collapsible-header">other</div><div class="collapsible-content">

"other" is the last of the quantifiers we haven't introduced:
<div class="table-container"><table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>en</th>

<tbody>
<tr>
<td>I saw a <b>another</b> cat</td>

<div class="section-h3"><div class="collapsible-header">Self, own, each other</div><div class="collapsible-content">

If the subject of a verb is the same as an object, you can use "self". It doesn't get tangled weirdly into verbs like Spanish "se" or German "sich". Using "self" doesn't change the meaning of the verb at all.
<div class="table-container"><table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>en</th>
<th>gloss</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>he washed the towel</td>
<td><span class="gloss">this</span> <span class="gloss">back</span> <span class="gloss">do</span> <span class="gloss">no-dirt</span> <span class="gloss">water-flat-stuff</span></td>

The English word "own", in the sense of "their own", really means "of their self". It is expressed this way in Sesowi (as it is in Chinese):
<div class="table-container"><table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>en</th>
<th>gloss</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>he ate <b>his own</b> feces</td>
<td><span class="gloss">this</span> <span class="gloss">back</span> <span class="gloss">do</span> <span class="gloss">eat</span> <span class="gloss">animal-dirt</span> <span class="gloss-emph">of</span> <span class="gloss-emph">self</span></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>she didn't know <b>her own</b> name</td>
<td><span class="gloss">this</span> <span class="gloss">no</span> <span class="gloss">back</span> <span class="gloss">do</span> <span class="gloss">hard-think</span> <span class="gloss">self-talk</span> <span class="gloss-emph">of</span> <span class="gloss-emph">self</span></td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table></div>



To express "each other", use "other self":
<div class="table-container"><table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>en</th>
<th>gloss</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>they flog <b>themselves</b></td>
<td><span class="gloss">this-number</span> <span class="gloss">do</span> <span class="gloss">link-energy-arm</span> <span class="gloss-emph">self</span></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>they flog <b>each other</b></td>
<td><span class="gloss">this-number</span> <span class="gloss">do</span> <span class="gloss">link-energy-arm</span> <span class="gloss-emph">other</span> <span class="gloss-emph">self</span></td>
</tr>
</tbody>


</table></div><h4>Emphasis</h4>
English has a messy system of stressing a word with tone. Sesowi adopts the more common approach of adding a particle after a word to stress it, and this word is "self", much like how in English, we might say "he himself said so", or "he himself admitted himself that he suck".
<div class="table-container"><table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>en</th>
<th>gloss</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>what did you say?</td>

This also ends up sounding like the emphatic clitics in Irish.



</div></div>
<div class="section-h3"><div class="collapsible-header">also, again</div><div class="collapsible-content">
"Also" is a funny little word that basically just adds some emphasis. It's a regular adjective/adverb in Sesowi, like in English:

<div class="table-container"><table border="1">
<thead>
<tr><th>en</th><th>gloss</th></tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr><td>I <b>also</b> saw a cat<br/>I <b>too</b> saw a cat<br/>I saw a cat <b>as well</b></td><td><span class="gloss">me</span> <span class="gloss-emph">other-thing</span> <span class="gloss">back</span> <span class="gloss">do</span> <span class="gloss">see</span> <span class="gloss">cat</span> </td></tr>
<tr><td>The cat is <b>also</b> small<br/>The cat is small <b>as well</b></td><td><span class="gloss">cat</span> <span class="gloss-emph">other-thing</span> <span class="gloss">like</span> <span class="gloss">small</span> </td></tr>
</tbody>
</table></div>



Again is also a straightforward adverb:
<div class="table-container"><table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>en</th>
<th>gloss</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>I saw a cat <b>again</b></td>
<td><span class="gloss">me</span> <span class="gloss-emph">other-time</span> <span class="gloss">do</span> <span class="gloss">see</span> <span class="gloss">cat</span></td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table></div>

      <li id="fn:1">There is a gray zone with words like "want" and "must". In German, "want" is a modal, but in English, it is a verb. In both, "must" is modal, even though you can also need an object. <a href="#fnref:1" title="Jump back to footnote 1 in the text">‚Ü©</a></li>
      <li id="fn:2">For example, in English, there is no infinitive for modals. You can't say *"He wants to <b>can</b> go" or *"Will she <b>may</b> visit me?" you have to say "He wants to <b>be able to</b> go" and "Will she <b>be allowed to</b> visit me?" Similarly, in Chinese, you can say "ÊàëËÉΩÂî±Ê≠å", but you can't say *"Êàë<b>ÊÉ≥</b>ËÉΩÂî±Ê≠å". In German, modals are more like normal verbs, but only modals can have special constructions like "Sie hat das nicht sagen <b>d√ºrfen</b>". All in all, in many languages, modals function much more like adverbs than verbs, and some analyses don't treat them as verbs at all. <a href="#fnref:2" title="Jump back to footnote 2 in the text">‚Ü©</a></li>
      <li id="fn:3">"Want" is often treated oddly. In English it functions as a verb; in German it functions as a modal. In Chinese, you can use ÊÉ≥ only to want a verb, but not a noun. In Arabic, Irish, and Hebrew, there is no verb for wanting; you just say the object of verb is "from you". And even the English word "want" originally just means to lack. <a href="#fnref:3" title="Jump back to footnote 3 in the text">‚Ü©</a></li>
