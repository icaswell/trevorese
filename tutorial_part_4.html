            <p>You may have noticed this already, but in Sesowi, all words are actually nouns. A verb is just “doing” (<span class="gloss">do</span>) a noun, and an adjective is just being “like” (<span class="gloss">like</span>) a noun. Let's look at all the different parts of speech for the atom <span class="gloss">place</span> and <span class="gloss">front</span>:</p>

              <p>The "perfect" tense is common in Indo-European languages, and uses the auxiliarly verb (“have”)<sup><a href="#fn:1" id="fnref:1">1</a></sup> to mark it, as in the sentence “I have been to Germany” or “More people have been to Berlin than me”. All this is really conveying is that the action has, indeed, happened at least once, and likely many times, in contrast to a statement like “I went to Germany”, which just means you went a particular time. So in effect, the perfect is just saying that you went some time(s). And that indeed is how the Sesowi expresses it, as we have just seen.</p>

              <p>We have just learned how to express that something has happened at least once. What id you want to express that it is a <b>habitual action</b>, or has happened many times?  Just use <span class="gloss">number-time</span> (aka "multiple times")!</p>

              <p>English also has the curiously named tense, the pluperfect (the “had verbed” tense). This is specifically used for things that happened in the past and were already completed before another thing happened in the past — it’s kind of like “the past with respect to the past”. However, there is also a much simpler way of expressing the same thing in English: “already”. Sesowi takes this approach, with <span class="gloss">back</span>:</p>

              <p>The future-within-past in English has to be expressed with this rather cumbersome “were going to” construction, or the verb “would” which is ambiguous because “would” also has the separate meaning of the conditional mode.</p>

              <p>The last form is the simplest and most natural -- it's just like saying "the apple that fall". However, in some cases this becomes ambiguous. For example, if you associate the word "eat" with an apple, you assume that means that this means that the apple is <b>eaten</b>, but if you associate it with a bear, you assume that it is the one doing the eating. If you need to be explicit, you can use the explicit form above, or the passive <span class="gloss">life</span> construction:</p>

              <p>Note: the “sing” in “if you sing, I will hear you”, even though it looks like the present tense, is actually in the future. Sesowi treats it as such.</p>

              <h4>The Subjunctive</h4>
              <p>The subjunctive happens when there is something that is happening counterfactually. For instance, in none of the sentences “If you were to come”, “If you had come”, and “I hope you come” did you actually come. Many languages, for instance Indo-European languages, have all sorts of complex ways of dealing with this situation. Sesowi, like Chinese, Telugu, Toki Pona, and so on, sidesteps this and leaves them ambiguous:</p>

              <p>Now, in some cases, the fact that the subjunctive and the indicative are the same may be annoying. The default interpretation is that we are talking about a subjunctive event.

          <div class="collapsible-content">
              <p>The passive is a somewhat unusual construction that crops up in some form or other in many languages. It can either be used to omit a subject, or to take responsibility away from them. Let’s look at the first example first. Irish has its own conjugation, e.g. “déartear” – it is said. German uses even more “it: than English, e.g. “It gonged”, “It is whispered in the ear”. Spanish, Hebrew, and others just leave off the subject from the sentence. In short: any language needs some way to have sentences that don’t have a clear subject. Consider the following sentence:</p>
              <ul>
                  <li>the milk was spilled</li>
              </ul>
              <p>All this is saying is that someone or something spilled the milk, but the speaker is not saying who -- it's just <span class="en"><i>some</i>one</span> or <span class="en"><i>some</i>thing</span>. Sesowi uses a generic noun, equivalent to saying "Someone spilled the milk", but can also leave off the subject entirely:</p>

              <p>Now, what about the version of the passive that has a subject attached to it?</p>
              <ul>
                  <li>the milk was spilled by Fred</li>
              </ul>
              <p>The only difference between this and the active voice is that it takes some responsibility away from Fred. This distinction doesn’t add much to the expressivity of the language, and can safely be removed. As such, Sesowi just uses the active voice in these constructions:</p>

          <div class="collapsible-header">“It”: Impersonal Aspect</div>
          <div class="collapsible-content">
            <p>Similar to the passive, the impersonal aspect is another way to avoid saying the subject. This comes up when there isn’t a subject, for instance for weather. With <i>it is raining</i> or <i>it is dark</i>, there is not really anything that the <i>it</i> refers to, excepting perhaps the universe itself. The only reason that “it” is added is because the grammar of the language demands some subject for the verb. In a language like Spanish, where subjects are not necessary, the subject is simply omitted: llueve means it rains. You can’t say <span class="wrong">*él llueve</span> or something like that. Hebrew is the same (pro-drop).</p>
              <p>Although grammarians tend to think of the impersonal aspect as different from the passive voice, the authors of this work contend that they are actually the same. The only difference is that for the impersonal aspect, one is forced to omit the subject because there isn’t a subject, whereas for the passive, you choose to, because you don’t know who the subject is (or don’t want to say).</p>
              <p>What do we do in Sesowi? We can omit the subject, as in the passive, or use <span class="gloss">this</span>, in the sense of “this all is raining”. You can think of this use of “this” as someone gesturing in front of them and saying “all of this”.</p>

              <p>In some cases, using <span class="gloss">this</span> may seem ambiguous, if there is already another <span class="gloss">this</span> in the sentence, for instance a person. For instance, imagine we are talking about some guy:</p>
