Questions and commands  are formed by adding the particles <span class="gloss">what</span> and <span class="gloss">with</span> at the end of the sentence:

<div class="section-h3"><div class="collapsible-header">Quantifiers and the wh- words</div><div class="collapsible-content">
    This <span class="gloss">what</span> that we have been using to form questions is what is called (in Sesowi grammar) a quantifier. Quantifiers are little words that tell us something about the way that an object exists. They come before the noun. The quantifiers we have seen so far are <span class="gloss">this</span>, <span class="gloss">that</span>, <span class="gloss">what</span>, <span class="gloss">number</span>, no</span>, and numbers, like 67.

Two more words that fall in this category in English are <span class="english">some</span> and <span class="english">any</span>. For the most part these are entirely unnecessary in Sesowi:


<div class="table-container"><table border="1">
  <thead>
  <tr><th>en</th><th>gloss</th></tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
  <tr><td>someone is coming!<br/>
  anyone is coming!<br/>
  A person is coming!<br/></td>
  <td><span class="gloss">person</span> <span class="gloss">do</span> <span class="gloss">this-go</span>!</td>
  <tr><td>I want to live somewhere warm.<br/>
  I want to live anywhere warm.<br/>
  I want to live in a warm place.<br/></td>
  <td><span class="gloss">me</span> <span class="gloss">do</span> <span class="gloss">want</span> <span class="gloss">life</span> <span class="gloss-emph">place</span> <span class="gloss">like</span> <span class="gloss">middle-hot</span></td>
   <tr><td>You say something<br/>
  You say anything<br/>
  You say a thing<br/></td>
  <td><span class="gloss">you</span> <span class="gloss">do</span> <span class="gloss">talk</span> <span class="gloss-emph">thing</span>.</td>
  </tbody>
  </table></div>
  
 

However, if you need to stress the non-specificness of something, you can use <span class="gloss">no-specific</span>:

<div class="table-container"><table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>en</th>
<th>gloss</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>Which cat do you talk to?</td>
<td><span class="gloss">you</span> <span class="gloss">do</span> <span class="gloss">talk</span> <span class="gloss">direction</span> <span class="gloss">what</span> <span class="gloss">cat</span>?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Oh, just <b>some cat</b></td>
<td><span class="gloss">that</span>, <span class="gloss">self</span> <span class="gloss-emph">cat</span> <span class="gloss-emph">like</span> <span class="gloss-emph">no-specific</span>.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Please just say <b>anything!</b></td>
<td><span class="gloss">you</span> <span class="gloss">do</span> <span class="gloss">talk</span> <span class="gloss-emph">thing</span> <span class="gloss-emph">like</span> <span class="gloss-emph">no-specific</span> <span class="gloss">with</span> <span class="gloss">self</span>!</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table></div>




There is one more of these, <span class="gloss">all</span>, meaning <span class="english">every/each</span> or <span class="english">complete:</span><div class="table-container"><table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>en</th>
<th>gloss</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>You know <b>every</b>thing</td>
<td><span class="gloss">you</span> <span class="gloss">do</span> <span class="gloss">hard-think</span> <span class="gloss-emph">all</span> <span class="gloss">thing</span>.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>You like <b>all</b> cats</td>
<td><span class="gloss">you</span> <span class="gloss">do</span> <span class="gloss">like</span> <span class="gloss-emph">all</span> <span class="gloss">cat</span></td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table></div>



With these in our arsenal, we can now express an amazing range of things. Let’s introduce some more words:
<div class="table-container"><table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>en</th>
<th>gloss</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>place</td>
<td><span class="gloss">place</span></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>thing</td>
<td><span class="gloss">thing</span></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>time</td>
<td><span class="gloss">time</span></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>reason</td>
<td><span class="gloss">reason</span></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>way</td>
<td><span class="gloss">way</span></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>amount/number</td>
<td><span class="gloss">number</span></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>person</td>
<td><span class="gloss">person</span></td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table></div>


These words are very powerful when combined with the quantifiers ! Let’s see what happens when we combine them with the question word <span class="gloss">what</span>:<div class="table-container"><table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>en</th>
<th>gloss</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>which? / what?</td>
<td><span class="gloss">what</span>?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>where?</td>
<td><span class="gloss">what</span> <span class="gloss">place</span>?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>what?</td>
<td><span class="gloss">what</span> <span class="gloss">thing</span>?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>when?</td>
<td><span class="gloss">what</span> <span class="gloss">time</span>?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>why?</td>
<td><span class="gloss">what</span> <span class="gloss">reason</span>?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>how?</td>
<td><span class="gloss">what</span> <span class="gloss">way</span>?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>how much?</td>
<td><span class="gloss">what</span> <span class="gloss">number</span>?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>who?</td>
<td><span class="gloss">what</span> <span class="gloss">person</span>?</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table></div>


How might you answer these questions?
<div class="table-container"><table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>en</th>
<th>gloss</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>here / there / somewhere</td>
<td><span class="gloss">this</span> <span class="gloss">place</span> / <span class="gloss">that</span> <span class="gloss">place</span> / <span class="gloss">place</span> (so <span class="gloss">no-specific</span>)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>this / that / something</td>
<td><span class="gloss">this</span> <span class="gloss">thing</span> / <span class="gloss">that</span> <span class="gloss">thing</span> / <span class="gloss">thing</span> (so <span class="gloss">no-specific</span>)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>now / then / sometime</td>
<td><span class="gloss">this</span> <span class="gloss">time</span> / <span class="gloss">that</span> <span class="gloss">time</span> / <span class="gloss">time</span>  (so <span class="gloss">no-specific</span>)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>because (for this reason) / because (for that reason) / just because (for some reason)</td>
<td><span class="gloss">this</span> <span class="gloss">reason</span> / <span class="gloss">that</span> <span class="gloss">reason</span> / <span class="gloss">reason</span>  (so <span class="gloss">no-specific</span>)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>this much / that much / some amount</td>
<td><span class="gloss">this</span> <span class="gloss">number</span> / <span class="gloss">that</span> <span class="gloss">number</span> / <span class="gloss">number</span>  (so <span class="gloss">no-specific</span>)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>thus (in this way) / thus (in that way) / somehow</td>
<td><span class="gloss">this</span> <span class="gloss">way</span> / <span class="gloss">that</span> <span class="gloss">way</span> / <span class="gloss">way</span>  (so <span class="gloss">no-specific</span>)</td>

<tr>

<td><span class="gloss">this</span> <span class="gloss">person</span> / <span class="gloss">that</span> <span class="gloss">person</span> / <span class="gloss">person</span>  (so <span class="gloss">no-specific</span>)</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table></div>



Similarly, with the universal quantifier:
<div class="table-container"><table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>en</th>
<th>gloss</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>everywhere</td>
<td><span class="gloss">all</span> <span class="gloss">place</span></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>everything</td>
<td><span class="gloss">all</span> <span class="gloss">thing</span></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>every time / all the time</td>
<td><span class="gloss">all</span> <span class="gloss">time</span></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>for every reason</td>
<td><span class="gloss">all</span> <span class="gloss">reason</span></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>??</td>
<td><span class="gloss">all</span> <span class="gloss">number</span></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>??</td>
<td><span class="gloss">all</span> <span class="gloss">way</span></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>everyone</td>
<td><span class="gloss">all</span> <span class="gloss">person</span></td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table></div>



Look closely at these. In English, we have so many different words for these concepts, and it hides how similar they all are! It is common for a language to be like English in this way, and have some collection of concepts from different roots and languages, such that the true structure is hidden. However, several other languages actually make these relations perfectly clear — for instance Telugu, what uses exactly the structure described above!

</div></div>
<div class="section-h3"><div class="collapsible-header">an adjective can be a whole sentence! (relative clauses)</div><div class="collapsible-content">
Let’s get back to adjectives. As you recall, adjectives are just formed by saying that a noun is <b>like</b> another noun:
<div class="table-container"><table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>en</th>
<th>gloss</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>a cat</td>
<td><span class="gloss">cat</span></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>a black cat</td>
<td><span class="gloss">cat</span> <span class="gloss">like</span> <span class="gloss">dark-color</span></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>a little baby</td>
<td><span class="gloss">small-small-person</span> <span class="gloss">like</span> <span class="gloss">small</span></td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table></div>



But what if you want to say that the cat is like something more complicated than a single noun? What if you want to say that the cat is like a little baby?
<div class="table-container"><table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>en</th>
<th>gloss</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>a cat <b>that is like</b> a little baby</td>
<td><span class="gloss">cat</span> <span class="gloss-emph">like</span> <span class="gloss">small-small-person</span> <span class="gloss">like</span> <span class="gloss">small</span></td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table></div>



You can do that too! In fact, you can put a full sentence in front of the <span class="gloss">like</span>, as long as it describes how that cat is:
<div class="table-container"><table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>en</th>
<th>gloss</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>The cat I saw yesterday</td>
<td><span class="gloss">cat</span> <span class="gloss-emph">like</span> <span class="gloss">me</span> <span class="gloss">back</span> <span class="gloss">do</span> <span class="gloss">see</span> (<span class="gloss">this</span>) <span class="gloss">back-light-time</span></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>the cat that is meowing sadly</td>
<td><span class="gloss">cat</span> <span class="gloss-emph">like</span> (<span class="gloss">this</span>)/gc <span class="gloss">do</span> <span class="gloss">cat-sound</span> <span class="gloss">like</span> <span class="gloss">no-good-energy</span></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>the cat that is meowing sadly at me</td>
<td><span class="gloss">cat</span> <span class="gloss-emph">like</span> (<span class="gloss">this</span>)/gc <span class="gloss">do</span> <span class="gloss">cat-sound</span> <span class="gloss">like</span> <span class="gloss">no-good-energy</span> <span class="gloss">direction</span> <span class="gloss">me</span></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>the cat that I think is meowing sadly at me</td>
<td><span class="gloss">cat</span> <span class="gloss-emph">like</span> <span class="gloss">me</span> <span class="gloss">do</span> <span class="gloss">think</span> <span class="gloss">do</span> <span class="gloss">cat-sound</span> <span class="gloss">like</span> <span class="gloss">no-good-energy</span> <span class="gloss">direction</span> <span class="gloss">me</span></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>the cat that I don’t know where he is</td>
<td><span class="gloss">cat</span> <span class="gloss-emph">like</span> <span class="gloss">me</span> <span class="gloss">no</span> <span class="gloss">hard-think</span> <span class="gloss">this</span> <span class="gloss">do</span> <span class="gloss">be</span> <span class="gloss">what</span> <span class="gloss">place</span></td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table></div>



Note that according to the “proper” English grammar, this last example is impossible to express. As you can see, “like” is a very powerful tool! It is used anywhere English uses “that” to start a relative clause.

NB: The <span class="gloss">this</span> is optional here, and usually left out; it is included in parentheses for completeness

<div class="section-h3"><div class="collapsible-header">Comparative and Superlative</div><div class="collapsible-content">
When we compare things in Sesowi, we can think of them as if they are on a mountain, with the higher ones up being more of that adjective, and the one on the top being the most of that adjective!

We can do this with <span class="gloss">like</span> clauses. Here are the relevant words:
<div class="table-container"><table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>en</th>
<th>gloss</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>over</td>
<td><span class="gloss">over</span></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>under</td>
<td><span class="gloss">down</span></td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table></div>



To make a comparative statement like <span class="english">I am bigger than you</span>, we say something like &lt;I am big over you&gt;, similar to how in Nigerian Pidgin you would say “I am big past you”:
<div class="table-container"><table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>en</th>
<th>gloss</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>That cat is sweet<b>er</b> than this cat</td>
<td><span class="gloss">That</span> <span class="gloss">cat</span> <span class="gloss">like</span> <span class="gloss">sugar</span> <span class="gloss-emph">over</span> <span class="gloss">this</span> <span class="gloss">cat</span></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>My cat is bigg<b>er</b> than your dog</td>
<td><span class="gloss">cat</span> <span class="gloss">of</span> <span class="gloss">me</span> <span class="gloss">like</span> <span class="gloss">big</span> <span class="gloss-emph">over</span> <span class="gloss">of-back-go-animal</span> <span class="gloss">of</span> <span class="gloss">you</span></td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table></div>



Consider the following argument between two people about which cat is sweeter:
<div class="table-container"><table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>en</th>
<th>gloss</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>this cat is sweet</td>
<td><span class="gloss">this</span> <span class="gloss">cat</span> <span class="gloss">like</span> <span class="gloss">sugar</span></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Yes, he is <b>very sweet</b></td>
<td><span class="gloss">truth</span>, <span class="gloss">this</span> <span class="gloss">like</span> <span class="gloss-emph">big</span> <span class="gloss-emph">sugar</span></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>But that cat is <b>sweeter than</b> this cat</td>
<td><span class="gloss">against</span> <span class="gloss">that</span> <span class="gloss">cat</span> <span class="gloss">like</span> <span class="gloss-emph">sugar</span> <span class="gloss-emph">over</span> <span class="gloss">this</span> <span class="gloss">cat</span></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>That cat is <b>sweeter</b></td>
<td><span class="gloss">that</span> <span class="gloss">cat</span> <span class="gloss">like</span> <span class="gloss-emph">sugar</span> <span class="gloss-emph">over</span></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>This cat is <b>less sweet than</b> that cat</td>
<td><span class="gloss">this</span> <span class="gloss">cat</span> <span class="gloss">like</span> <span class="gloss-emph">sugar</span> <span class="gloss-emph">down</span> <span class="gloss">that</span> <span class="gloss">cat</span></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>That cat is<b> much sweeter than</b> this cat</td>
<td><span class="gloss">that</span> <span class="gloss">cat</span> <span class="gloss">like</span> <span class="gloss-emph">big</span> <span class="gloss-emph">sugar</span> <span class="gloss-emph">over</span> <span class="gloss">this</span> <span class="gloss">cat</span></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>This cat is <b>much less sweet than</b> that cat</td>
<td><span class="gloss">this</span> <span class="gloss">cat</span> <span class="gloss">like</span> <span class="gloss-emph">big</span> <span class="gloss-emph">sugar</span> <span class="gloss-emph">down</span> <span class="gloss">that</span> <span class="gloss">cat</span></td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table></div>



Hopefully, they will eventually reach a conclusion like the following:
<div class="table-container"><table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>en</th>
<th>gloss</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>That cat is <b>as sweet as</b> this cat</td>
<td><span class="gloss">that</span> <span class="gloss">cat</span> <span class="gloss">like</span> <span class="gloss-emph">sugar</span> <span class="gloss-emph">one-kind</span> <span class="gloss-emph">of</span> <span class="gloss">this</span> <span class="gloss">cat</span></td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table></div>



On the other hand, they might start using the superlative:
<div class="table-container"><table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>en</th>
<th>gloss</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>That cat is <b>the sweetest</b></td>
<td><span class="gloss">that</span> <span class="gloss">cat</span> <span class="gloss">like</span> <span class="gloss-emph">over-thing</span> <span class="gloss-emph">sugar</span></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>That cat is <b>the least sweet</b></td>
<td><span class="gloss">that</span> <span class="gloss">cat</span> <span class="gloss">like</span> <span class="gloss-emph">down-thing</span> <span class="gloss-emph">sugar</span></td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table></div>


Note: you could also express this as “that cat like <b>sweetness beyond all</b>”, though this is less idiomatic.

</div></div>
<div class="section-h3"><div class="collapsible-header">Verbs 3: Verbs acting on other verbs: tenses and modals</div><div class="collapsible-content">
We have seen how to use a verb with a noun as its object:
normal verb: <span class="english">I see a dog</span> (the object of <span class="english">see</span> is <span class="english">dog</span> is a noun)
Now let’s talk about verbs that act on other verbs, which we can call “modal verbs”:
modal verb: <span class="english">I can sing</span> (the object of <span class="english">can</span> is <span class="english">sing,</span> a verb)

The most common verbs that act on other verbs are a set of five or so verbs that actually can ONLY<sup><a href="#fn:1" id="fnref:1">1</a></sup> take verbs as objects. For instance, you <span class="english">I can sing</span> works, but <span class="english">I can the cat</span> has no meaning. These verbs are often called modal verbs in other languages, and usually function in special ways.<sup><a href="#fn:2" id="fnref:2">2</a></sup> Here is their use in Sesowi:
<div class="table-container"><table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>en</th>
<th>gloss</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>the cat <b>can (is able to)</b> talk</td>
<td><span class="gloss">cat</span> <span class="gloss-emph">can</span> <span class="gloss-emph">do</span> <span class="gloss">talk</span></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>the cat <b>may (is allowed to)</b> talk</td>
<td><span class="gloss">cat</span> <span class="gloss-emph">can</span> <span class="gloss-emph">do</span> <span class="gloss">talk</span></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>the cat <b>should (ought to)</b> talk</td>
<td><span class="gloss">cat</span> <span class="gloss-emph">must</span> <span class="gloss-emph">do</span> <span class="gloss">talk</span></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>the cat <b>might (possibly will)</b> talk</td>
<td><span class="gloss">cat</span> <span class="gloss-emph">possibility</span> <span class="gloss-emph">do</span> <span class="gloss">talk</span></td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table></div>


Then there are a lot of other verbs that can act on verbs OR nouns. In English/German/etc., these are treated differently; in Sesowi they are the same as the so-called “true modals”:
<div class="table-container"><table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>en</th>
<th>gloss</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>the cat <b>must (has to/needs to)</b> talk</td>
<td><span class="gloss">cat</span> <span class="gloss-emph">big-want</span> <span class="gloss-emph">do</span> <span class="gloss">talk</span></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>the cat <b>wants to</b> talk</td>
<td><span class="gloss">cat</span> <span class="gloss">want</span> <span class="gloss">do</span> <span class="gloss">talk</span></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>the cat <b>tries to</b> talk</td>
<td><span class="gloss">cat</span> <span class="gloss">seek</span> <span class="gloss">do</span> <span class="gloss">talk</span></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>the cat <b>likes to</b> talk</td>
<td><span class="gloss">cat</span> <span class="gloss">good-energy</span> <span class="gloss">do</span> <span class="gloss">talk</span></td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table></div>



Important note: You may notice that there is only one do at the end here, and not before the first verb! This is optional (but preferred). You can also explicitly add all the do s:

<div class="table-container"><table border="1">
<thead>
<tr><th>en</th><th>gloss</th></tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr><td>the cat <b>can</b> talk</td><td><span class="gloss">cat</span> <span class="gloss-emph">can</span> <span class="gloss-emph">do</span> <span class="gloss">talk</span> [normal form]<br/><span class="gloss">cat</span> <span class="gloss-emph">do</span> <span class="gloss-emph">can</span> <span class="gloss-emph">do</span> <span class="gloss">talk</span> [explicit form>]</td></tr>
<tr><td>the cat <b>wants to</b> talk</td><td><span class="gloss">cat</span> <span class="gloss">want</span> <span class="gloss">do</span> <span class="gloss">talk</span> [normal form>]<br/><span class="gloss">cat</span> <span class="gloss">do</span> <span class="gloss-emph">want</span> <span class="gloss-emph">do</span> <span class="gloss">talk</span> [explicit form>]</td></tr>
</tbody>
</table></div>




Verbs that act on other verbs are incredibly powerful, and capture all the different ways you can perform a noun – including tense!  When we told you about tenses before, we only told you half the story. What we didn’t tell you is that the two tense markers we taught you — <span class="gloss">back</span> and <span class="gloss">front</span> — are in fact themselves just a special case of verbs acting on verbs. Observe:

<div class="table-container"><table border="1">
<thead>
<tr><th>en</th><th>gloss</th></tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr><td>the cat <b>is</b> talk<b>ing</b><br/>the cat <b>talks</b></td><td><span class="gloss">cat</span> <span class="gloss-emph">do</span> <span class="gloss">talk</span></td></tr>
<tr><td>the cat <b>did</b> talk<br/>the cat talk<b>ed</b></td><td><span class="gloss">cat</span> <span class="gloss">back</span> <span class="gloss-emph">do</span> <span class="gloss">talk</span></td></tr>
<tr><td>the cat <b>will</b> talk<br/>the cat <b>is going to</b> talk</td><td><span class="gloss">cat</span> <span class="gloss-emph">front</span> <span class="gloss-emph">do</span> <span class="gloss">talk</span></td></tr>
</tbody>
</table></div>


All these constructions are all formed the same way! And indeed, in Sesowi, there is no difference between “tenses” and “modal verbs”. The concept of a “tense” as it is usually conceived is based on how Indo-European languages work, where tenses are treated in a special way, but modals are treated more like verbs. However, in other languages, it’s not so. In Chinese, Vietnamese, or Malay, tenses are expressed as adverbs, and in Telugu, tenses and modals are in the same category of suffixes!

Does this last sentence look a bit extreme? It’s really not! consider this dialogue:
A: “Hey, you said your organization was going to create a robot, right? How’d that go? Were you going to let it talk to other employees?”
B: “It went terribly. It should not have been allowed to be able to try to talk to others. We shouldn’t have let it even have the capability to initiate conversation.”


<h4>multiple verbs acting on verbs with adverbs in between</h4>
One small example should suffice to show how this is simpler in Sesowi:
<div class="table-container"><table>
<thead>

<tr>
<td>the cat should not be able to talk</td>
<td><span class="gloss">cat</span> <span class="gloss">no</span> <span class="gloss">must</span> <span class="gloss">can</span> <span class="gloss">do</span> <span class="gloss">talk</span></td>

TODO make the above have highlights of corresponding colors
TODO clarify the two meanings of "should have been" etc.


<h4>Note on “want” and other verbs that can act on nouns OR verbs</h4>
“Want” is a special word that deserves its own section. You can 1) want something (“want” is a verb), 2) want to do something (“want” is a modal verb); 3) want to be something; or 4) want that something happens.<sup><a href="#fn:3" id="fnref:3">3</a></sup> These are straightforward but worth mentioning:
<div class="table-container"><table border="1">
<thead>
<tr><th>en</th><th>gloss</th></tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr><td>the cat wants a mouse</td><td><span class="gloss">cat</span> <span class="gloss">do</span> <span class="gloss">want</span> <span class="gloss">tooth-animal</span></td></tr>
<tr><td>the cat wants to sing</td><td><span class="gloss">cat</span> <span class="gloss">want</span> <span class="gloss">do</span> <span class="gloss">good-sound</span> [normal form>]<br/><span class="gloss">cat</span> <span class="gloss">do</span> <span class="gloss">want</span> <span class="gloss">do</span> <span class="gloss">good-sound</span> [explicit form>]</td></tr>
<tr><td>the cat wants to be a mouse</td><td><span class="gloss">cat</span> <span class="gloss">want</span> <span class="gloss">do</span> <span class="gloss">be</span> <span class="gloss">tooth-animal</span></td></tr>
<tr><td>the cat wants to be able to talk</td><td><span class="gloss">cat</span> <span class="gloss">want</span> <span class="gloss">can</span> <span class="gloss">do</span> <span class="gloss">talk</span></td></tr>
<tr><td>the cat wants the mouse to be here</td><td><span class="gloss">cat</span> <span class="gloss">want</span> <span class="gloss">tooth-animal</span> <span class="gloss">do</span> <span class="gloss">be</span> <span class="gloss">this-place</span></td></tr>
</tbody>
</table></div>




This is the same story for any verb that can take a noun or a verb as its object, like “try”, “like”, “need”, etc.

You may have been confused about this “explicit form” business for when verbs act on other verbs. Now you can see the reasoning more clearly:
normal form (only put “do” before last verb)
clearly signals that you’re wanting an action instead of an object
easier to say (don’t repeat “do”)
explicit form (“do” before every verb)
“the cat wants to sing” and “the cat wants a mouse” are more parallel because they both start with “cat do want”

Overall, you can ignore this though! use whichever one you want.

More examples:

</table></div><h4>More verbs acting on Verbs: the “Instrumental case”</h4>
Many languages have a special way of marking things when they are being used to do something. Sesowi, like Chinese, simply uses “use”. It is just another case of a verb acting on another verb.

Note that the English “with” here is an instrumental marker in English, and actually a quite different meaning from the normal meaning. For the normal meaning of “with”, this would mean “He and a shovel were digging a hole”!

<div class="section-h3"><div class="collapsible-header">Indirect objects</div><div class="collapsible-content">
Some verbs have two objects. Consider the verbs “give” , “say”, “talk”, and “throw”. They can have a single object:

<div class="table-container"><table>

<td><span class="gloss">this</span> <span class="gloss">do</span> <span class="gloss">give</span> <span class="gloss">give-thing</span></td>

However, you can also add a second object with a preposition like <b>to</b> or <b>at.</b> This second object is called the indirect object. Just as English, Sesowi marks these with the preposition “to” (aka <span class="gloss">direction</span>)<div class="table-container"><table>

To an English speaker, this should be pretty straightforward: you just indicate the recipient of the verb phrase with <span class="gloss">direction</span>. Why is it worth mentioning? First of all, other languages treat indirect objects differently (e.g. with the Dative case). Second of all, English has another way of  marking the indirect object, just by using the word order:
<div class="table-container"><table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>en</th>
<th>gloss</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>He gives <b>me</b> a gift</td>
<td><span class="gloss">this</span> <span class="gloss">do</span> <span class="gloss">give</span> <span class="gloss">give-thing</span> <span class="gloss-emph">direction</span> <span class="gloss-emph">me</span></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>He talks <b>to me</b> about work</td>
<td><span class="gloss">this</span> <span class="gloss">do</span> <span class="gloss">talk</span> <span class="gloss">hard-do</span> <span class="gloss-emph">direction</span> <span class="gloss-emph">me</span></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>He throws <b>me</b> a rock</td>
<td><span class="gloss">this</span> <span class="gloss">do</span> <span class="gloss">no-link</span> <span class="gloss">hard-thing</span> <span class="gloss-emph">direction</span> <span class="gloss-emph">me</span></td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table></div>


In Sesowi, you can never omit the preposition <span class="gloss">direction</span>  for the indirect object.

There are a few verbs in English that use “to” even when it appears to be a direct object. For instance, you talk to someone. However, in these cases this is because there is an implied indirect object: when you talk to someone, you are actually saying words (the direct object) to someone (the indirect object). The situation is the same for Sesowi: for these verbs with implied objects, we use the preposition <span class="gloss">direction</span><div class="table-container"><table>:
<thead>
<tr>
<th>en</th>
<th>gloss</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>He <b>talks about</b> people</td>
<td><span class="gloss">this</span> <span class="gloss">do</span> <span class="gloss-emph">talk</span> <span class="gloss">number</span> <span class="gloss">person</span></td>

</table></div>


This point should not pose problems for speakers of English: they should just translate “to” into <span class="gloss">direction</span>. This should be familiar also to speakers of Chinese, where direction can be interpreted as 对: one can see that above, the treatment of <span class="english">to talk</span> is the same as Chinese 说 vs 说对.

Note 1: In Chinese, there is the exact same phenomenon, where if there is no particle, the first object is the indirect object and the second is direct (I give you a thing / 我给你一个东西). if you invert the order of the objects but want the same meaning, you need to add a particle (I give a thing <b>to</b> you / 我<b>把</b>一个东西给你). However, instead of marking the indirect object, Chinese marks the direct object.

When speaking, we need some way to differentiate between these two objects.  For example, “give me to the girl” and  “give me the girl”  are very different sentences.

Note 2: Interestingly, in English there are also verbs where you are not allowed to use the word order, and you have to use a preposition. Consider the word <span class="english">say.</span> While you can say <span class="english">Give me the cat</span>, you can’t say <span class="wrong">*Say me the thing</span>.

<div class="section-h3"><div class="collapsible-header">Verbs 4: Infinitives and gerunds</div><div class="collapsible-content">
In Indo-European languages like English, verbs have a special form called the infinitive, which is used in certain situations when there isn’t a subject doing the verb. In English, you can often use the gerund (-ing form) in similar ways.

Many situations where IE languages use the infinitive is when you have a verb acting on another verb. We already saw how to do this:
<div class="table-container"><table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>en</th>
<th>gloss</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>the cat wants the mouse <b>to be</b> here</td>
<td><span class="gloss">cat</span> [do] <span class="gloss">want</span> <span class="gloss">tooth-animal</span> <span class="gloss-emph">do</span> <span class="gloss-emph">be</span> <span class="gloss">this-place</span></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>She doesn’t like <b>walking</b> / She doesn’t like <b>to walk</b></td>
<td><span class="gloss">this</span> <span class="gloss">no</span> [do] <span class="gloss">like</span> <span class="gloss-emph">do</span> <span class="gloss-emph">arm-go</span></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>He thinks of <b>talking</b></td>
<td><span class="gloss">this</span> [do] <span class="gloss">think</span> <span class="gloss-emph">do</span> <span class="gloss-emph">talk</span></td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table></div>



Another situation where IE languages use an infinitive or gerund is when you are referring to the general state of a verb, as in “walking is good” or “It is good to walk.”. In this case, the verb has become a sort of noun, meaning “the state of walking”. In Sesowi, we just need to add the “do” to show that it is a verb, and then you can use it like any other noun:
<div class="table-container"><table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>en</th>
<th>gloss</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td><b>Walking</b> is good / It is good <b>to walk</b>.</td>
<td><span class="gloss-emph">do</span> <span class="gloss-emph">arm-go</span> <span class="gloss">do</span> <span class="gloss">be</span> <span class="gloss">good</span>.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>He thinks <b>talking</b> is hard / it is hard <b>to talk</b></td>
<td><span class="gloss">this</span> <span class="gloss">do</span> <span class="gloss">think</span> <span class="gloss-emph">do</span> <span class="gloss-emph">talk</span> <span class="gloss">do</span> <span class="gloss">be</span> <span class="gloss">no-easy</span></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><b>Being</b> a student is fun / It is fun <b>to be</b> a student.</td>
<td><span class="gloss-emph">do</span> <span class="gloss-emph">be</span> <span class="gloss">get-think-person</span> <span class="gloss">do</span> <span class="gloss">be</span> <span class="gloss">play</span></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>You <b>being</b> here makes me happy.</td>
<td><span class="gloss">you</span> <span class="gloss-emph">do</span> <span class="gloss-emph">be</span> <span class="gloss">this</span> <span class="gloss">place</span> <span class="gloss">do</span>  <span class="gloss">me</span> <span class="gloss">good-energy</span>.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><b>The fact that you are</b> here makes me happy.</td>
<td><span class="gloss">you</span> <span class="gloss-emph">do</span> <span class="gloss-emph">be</span> <span class="gloss">this</span> <span class="gloss">place</span> <span class="gloss">do</span>  <span class="gloss">me</span> <span class="gloss">good-energy</span>.</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table></div>


Serendipitously, this ends up sounding similar to the English construction “to Verb”!

Finally, there are situations in English where gerunds like <span class="english">being</span> pop up just because English uses “to be” for adjectives as well:
<div class="table-container"><table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>en</th>
<th>gloss</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>He was being cute</td>
<td><span class="gloss">this</span> <span class="gloss">back</span> <span class="gloss">like</span> <span class="gloss">can-love</span></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>She is being mean to me</td>
<td><span class="gloss">this</span> <span class="gloss">like</span> <span class="gloss">no-good</span> <span class="gloss-emph">direction</span> <span class="gloss">me</span></td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table></div>
</div></div>
<div class="section-h3"><div class="collapsible-header">Verbs 5: Clauses and conjunctions</div><div class="collapsible-content">

The most basic way to make two clauses in Sesowi is to just put two sentences one after the other:
<div class="table-container"><table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>en</th>
<th>gloss</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>I told you</td>
<td><span class="gloss">me</span> <span class="gloss">back</span> <span class="gloss">do</span> <span class="gloss">talk</span> <span class="gloss">you</span></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>the cat talked</td>
<td><span class="gloss">cat</span> <span class="gloss">back</span> <span class="gloss">do</span> <span class="gloss">talk</span></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>I told you (that) the cat talked</td>
<td><span class="gloss">me</span> <span class="gloss">back</span> <span class="gloss">do</span> <span class="gloss">talk</span>, <span class="gloss">you</span> <span class="gloss">cat</span> <span class="gloss">back</span> <span class="gloss">do</span> <span class="gloss">talk</span></td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table></div>


In English, we can optionally put a “that” in there to make the causality clear. In Sesowi, as in Chinese, there is no such word and you just put the clauses next to each other. Of course, you can also use conjunctions to connect two clauses:

<div class="table-container"><table>

The English word “own”, in the sense of “their own”, really means “of their self”. It is expressed this way in Sesowi (as it is in Chinese):
<div class="table-container"><table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>en</th>
<th>gloss</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>he ate <b>his own</b> feces</td>
<td><span class="gloss">this</span> <span class="gloss">back</span> <span class="gloss">do</span> <span class="gloss">eat</span> <span class="gloss">animal-dirt</span> <span class="gloss-emph">of</span> <span class="gloss-emph">self</span></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>she didn't know <b>her own</b> name</td>
<td><span class="gloss">this</span> <span class="gloss">no</span> <span class="gloss">back</span> <span class="gloss">do</span> <span class="gloss">hard-think</span> <span class="gloss">self-talk</span> <span class="gloss-emph">of</span> <span class="gloss-emph">self</span></td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table></div>



To express “each other”, use “other self”:
<div class="table-container"><table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>en</th>
<th>gloss</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>they flog <b>themselves</b></td>
<td><span class="gloss">number</span> <span class="gloss">this</span> <span class="gloss">do</span> <span class="gloss">link-energy-arm</span> <span class="gloss-emph">self</span></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>they flog <b>each other</b></td>
<td><span class="gloss">number</span> <span class="gloss">this</span> <span class="gloss">do</span> <span class="gloss">link-energy-arm</span> <span class="gloss-emph">other</span> <span class="gloss-emph">self</span></td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table></div><h4>Emphasis</h4>
English has a messy system of stressing a word with tone. Sesowi adopts the more common approach of adding a particle after a word to stress it, and this word is “self”, much like how in English, we might say “he himself said so”, or “he himself admitted himself that he suck”.
<div class="table-container"><table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>en</th>
<th>gloss</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>what did you say?</td>
<td><span class="gloss">you</span> <span class="gloss">back</span> <span class="gloss">do</span> <span class="gloss">talk</span> <span class="gloss">what</span> <span class="gloss">thing</span>?</td>

</tr>
<tr>
<td><b>you only</b> said that. [Indian English]</td>

This also ends up sounding like the emphatic clitics in Irish.

Also is a funny little word that basically just adds some emphasis. It’s a regular adjective/adverb in Sesowi, like in English:

<div class="table-container"><table border="1">
<thead>
<tr><th>en</th><th>gloss</th></tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr><td>I <b>also</b> saw a cat<br/>I <b>too</b> saw a cat<br/>I saw a cat <b>as well</b></td><td><span class="gloss">me</span> <span class="gloss">back</span> <span class="gloss">do</span> <span class="gloss">see</span> <span class="gloss">cat</span> <span class="gloss-emph">like</span> <span class="gloss-emph">other-thing</span></td></tr>
<tr><td>The cat is <b>also</b> small<br/>The cat is small <b>as well</b><br/>-</td><td><span class="gloss">cat</span> <span class="gloss">like</span> <span class="gloss">small</span> <span class="gloss-emph">like</span> <span class="gloss-emph">other-thing</span></td></tr>
</tbody>
</table></div>



Again is also a straightforward adverb:
<div class="table-container"><table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>en</th>
<th>gloss</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>I saw a cat <b>again</b></td>
<td><span class="gloss">me</span> <span class="gloss">back</span> <span class="gloss">do</span> <span class="gloss">see</span> <span class="gloss">cat</span> <span class="gloss-emph">like</span> <span class="gloss-emph">other-time</span></td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table></div>

TODO finish this and maybe put it in the lexicon section

Many Sesowi terms are more ambiguous than English terms. For instance, <span class="gloss">person</span> means any being, either human or animal; and <span class="gloss">no-side</span> means either a sphere or a circle. In 90% of the cases, these are unambiguous in context. However, what do you do if you really need to specify that something is a circle, not a sphere? In this case you can use the more explicit form, known as the disambiguation form. For instance:

<div class="table-container"><table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>en</th>
<th>gloss</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>sphere/circle</td>
<td><span class="gloss">no-side</span></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>sphere</td>
<td><span class="gloss">body-no-side</span> (aka <span class="english"></span>3d-ball</span>)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>circle</td>
<td><span class="gloss">flat-no-side</span> (aka <span class="english">flat ball</span>)</td>
</tr>
</tbody>

      <li id="fn:1">There is a gray zone with words like "want" and "must". In German, "want" is a modal, but in English, it is a verb. In both, "must" is modal, even though you can also need an object. <a href="#fnref:1" title="Jump back to footnote 1 in the text">↩</a></li>
      <li id="fn:2">For example, in English, there is no infinitive for modals. You can't say *"He wants to <b>can</b> go" or *"Will she <b>may</b> visit me?" you have to say "He wants to <b>be able to</b> go" and "Will she <b>be allowed to</b> visit me?" Similarly, in Chinese, you can say "我能唱歌", but you can't say *"我<b>想</b>能唱歌". In German, modals are more like normal verbs, but only modals can have special constructions like "Sie hat das nicht sagen <b>dürfen</b>". All in all, in many languages, modals function much more like adverbs than verbs, and some analyses don't treat them as verbs at all. <a href="#fnref:2" title="Jump back to footnote 2 in the text">↩</a></li>
      <li id="fn:3">"Want" is often treated oddly. In English it functions as a verb; in German it functions as a modal. In Chinese, you can use 想 only to want a verb, but not a noun. In Arabic, Irish, and Hebrew, there is no verb for wanting; you just say the object of verb is "from you". And even the English word "want" originally just means to lack. <a href="#fnref:3" title="Jump back to footnote 3 in the text">↩</a></li>
