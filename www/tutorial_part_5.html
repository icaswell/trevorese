                <p>Many languages treat nouns differently depending on whether they are animate (e.g., animals) or inanimate (e.g., rocks), and may even have different articles or pronouns. English makes an animate/inanimate distinction for some words, e.g., <strong>who</strong> vs. <strong>what</strong>, <strong>someone</strong> vs. <strong>something</strong>. While adjectives like "young" typically describe animate beings and "new" describes inanimate objects, there can be overlap. Sesowi does not grammatically distinguish animacy, but if clarity is needed, “thing” or “person”/“being” can be added:</p>

            <div class="collapsible-content">
                <p>English often uses pronouns like "it," "you," or "they" in an impersonal sense to refer to people in general. For example:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>It is generally believed that X...</li>
                    <li>You never know what’s going to happen.</li>
                    <li>You know what they say.</li>
                    <li>People are worried. (Or: They are worried.)</li>
                </ul>
                <p>In many cases, these can be translated into Sesowi using a general word like "people," or the intended meaning can be inferred from context. For instance, some languages like Hebrew use a third-person plural ("they") with pro-drop (omitting the pronoun) to convey this impersonal meaning.</p>

                </div>

                <p>The existence of dedicated words for "yes" and "no" may seem straightforward to English speakers, but it's not a universal feature in language. Latin, Irish, and Chinese, for example, traditionally answer yes-no questions by repeating the verb. This is why Hiberno-English (Irish English) features exchanges like:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Do you want tea?
                        <ul>
                            <li>I do. (Instead of “Yes.”)</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <p>Some languages have more than two options. French uses “si” to contradict a negative statement, and German uses “doch” for the same purpose. Early Modern English actually had a four-form system: <strong>yes</strong>, <strong>no</strong>, <strong>yea</strong>, and <strong>nay</strong>. "Yea" and "nay" answered positive questions, while "yes" and "no" were used to answer negative questions.</p>

                <p>In Sesowi, to emphasize a contradiction, you can add “but”:</p>

                <p>Several languages, like Hindi and Chinese, don’t have a separate word for “too” (excessively) and “very” (to a high degree). Sesowi distinguishes them. “Too” can be expressed with a word like <span class="gloss">over-much</span>.</p>
