                <p>Sesowi is pronounced just about the way it looks. The technically-minded can look at the Phonolgy tab for details. Just keep in mind that for a multi-syllabic word, don't get scared -- just pronounce it as the combination of its individual syllables!</p>

                <p>There are under 200 basic words from which all other words are built. These are called atoms. They all have the form <b>consonant+vowel[+optional ng]</b>. The simplest atom would simply have <b>consonant+vowel</b>, e.g. <span class="surface">ma</span>, or <span class="surface">su</span>. Atoms representing slightly more complex concepts use more use of compound consonants, diphthongs, and the nasal coda, e.g. <span class="surface">yau</span>, <span class="surface">kwe</span>, or <span class="surface">nang</span>.</p>
                <p>There are four special atoms that start with a vowel, representing the most basic concepts of <span class="gloss">this</span>, <span class="gloss">that</span>, <span class="gloss">all</span>, and <span class="gloss">what</span>. These are usually not used in compound words.</p>

                <p>Atoms themselves have broader meanings than English words, and if they are used by themselves they can be ambiguous. In this way they are more like Chinese characters. For example, <span class="gloss">arm</span> has the default meaning of <span class="english">arm</span>, but it can also refer to the hand, or the leg, or any limb. If context is not sufficient, you can use the <b>explicit forms</b> or <b>disambiguation forms</b>:</p>

                <p><b>Note to English speakers:</b> A good number of the world's languages, e.g. Greek and Chinese, do not differentiate "hand" and "arm". So this level of ambiguity is quite natural!</p>
