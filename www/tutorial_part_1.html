Each Trevorese syllable has the form CV[N], where C is a consonant, V is a vowel, and N is the sound “ng”.
<h4>Vowels</h4>
Trevorese has the five cardinal vowels <b>/aiuoe/</b>, as well as three diphthongs <b>/ai/</b>,<b>/au/</b>, and <b>/oi/</b>, which are pronounced exactly like the combination of the two vowels they are made of.
<h4>Consonants</h4>
Trevorese has 12 simple consonants, <b>/w/</b>,<b>/y/</b>,<b>/m/</b>,<b>/b/</b>,<b>/g/</b>,<b>/d/</b>,<b>/n/</b>,<b>/s/</b>,<b>/p/</b>,<b>/k/</b>,<b>/t/</b>,<b>/l/</b> and 11 compound consonants, <b>/ny/</b>,<b>/mw/</b>,<b>/bw/</b>,<b>/gw/</b>,<b>/dw/</b>,<b>/sw/</b>,<b>/pw/</b>,<b>/kw/</b>,<b>/tw/</b>. The compound consonants are pronounced exactly like the combination of their two constituents, e.g. /<b>k</b>ik/ sounds like “<b>k</b>ick” and /<b>kw</b>ik/ sounds like “<b>qu</b>ick”.
<h4>Phonotactics</h4>
A variety of possible syllables are never used by Trevorese, as they are deemed too easy to mistake with other syllables. For example, <span class="wrong">*nyi</span> and <span class="wrong">*yi</span> are too easy to mistake for <span class="surface">ni</span> and <span class="surface">i</span>, respectively. Diphthongs plus nasal coda, like <span class="wrong">*bwaing</span> or <span class="wrong">*saung</span>, are forbidden as they are deemed too hard to pronounce.

<div class="section-h3"><div class="collapsible-header">Atoms</div><div class="collapsible-content">
There are under 200 basic words from which all other words are built. These are called atoms. They all have the form consonant+vowel[+optional ng]. The simplest atom would simply have consonant+vowel, e.g. <span class="surface">ma</span>, or <span class="surface">su</span>. Atoms representing slightly more complex concepts use more use of compound consonants, diphthongs, and the nasal coda, e.g. <span class="surface">yau</span>, <span class="surface">kwe</span>, or <span class="surface">nang</span>.

There are six special atoms that start with a vowel, representing the most basic concepts of <span class="gloss">this</span>, <span class="gloss">that</span>, <span class="gloss">all</span>, <span class="gloss">what</span>, and <span class="gloss">foreign_marker</span>. These are usually not used in compound words.

<div class="section-h3"><div class="collapsible-header">Compounds</div><div class="collapsible-content">
Most words in Trevorese are compounds, composed of multiple syllables. It is always unambiguous what atoms a compound is made of. Here are some examples:

<div class="table-container"><table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>en</th>
<th>gloss</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>of/from</td>
<td><span class="gloss">of</span></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>from the back</td>
<td><span class="gloss">of-back</span></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>to follow (go from the back)</td>
<td><span class="gloss">of-back-go</span></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>dog (a following/loyal animal)</td>
<td><span class="gloss">of-back-go-animal</span></td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table></div>



If the compound is on the longer side, it can be written with a hyphen to show the etymology better:

<div class="table-container"><table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>en</th>
<th>gloss</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>dog</td>
<td><span class="gloss">of-back-go</span></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>forest</td>
<td><span class="gloss">big-plant-place</span></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>wolf (forest-dog)</td>
<td><span class="gloss">big-plant-place_of-back-go</span></td>
</tr>
</tbody>
