    Sesowi is pronounced just about the way it looks. The technically-minded can look at the Phonolgy tab for details. Just keep in mind that for a multi-syllabic word, don't get scared -- just pronounce it as the combination of its individual syllables!

<div class="section-h3"><div class="collapsible-header">Atoms</div><div class="collapsible-content">
    There are under 200 basic words from which all other words are built. These are called atoms. They all have the form <b>consonant+vowel[+optional ng]</b>. The simplest atom would simply have <b>consonant+vowel</b>, e.g. <span class="surface">ma</span>, or <span class="surface">su</span>. Atoms representing slightly more complex concepts use more use of compound consonants, diphthongs, and the nasal coda, e.g. <span class="surface">yau</span>, <span class="surface">kwe</span>, or <span class="surface">nang</span>.

There are four special atoms that start with a vowel, representing the most basic concepts of <span class="gloss">this</span>, <span class="gloss">that</span>, <span class="gloss">all</span>, and <span class="gloss">what</span>. These are usually not used in compound words.

<div class="section-h3"><div class="collapsible-header">Compounds</div><div class="collapsible-content">
Most words in Sesowi are compounds, composed of multiple atoms. It is always unambiguous what atoms a compound is made of. Here are some examples:

<div class="table-container"><table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>en</th>
<th>gloss</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>animal</td>
<td><span class="gloss">animal</span></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>snake (long-animal)</td>
<td><span class="gloss">long-animal</span></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>lizard (arm-snake)</td>
<td><span class="gloss">arm-long-animal</span></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>salamander (water-lizard)</td>
<td><span class="gloss">water-arm-long-animal</span></td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table></div>



If the compound is on the longer side, it can be written with a hyphen to show the etymology better:

<div class="table-container"><table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>en</th>
<th>gloss</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>dog</td>
<td><span class="gloss">big-good</span></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>forest</td>
<td><span class="gloss">big-plant-place</span></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>wolf (forest-dog)</td>
<td><span class="gloss">big-plant-place--big-good</span></td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table></div>


Atoms themselves have broader meanings than English words, and if they are used by themselves they can be ambiguous. In this way they are more like Chinese characters. For example, <span class="gloss">arm</span> has the default meaning of <span class="english">arm</span>, but it can also refer to the hand, or the leg, or any limb. If context is not sufficient, you can use the <b>explicit forms</b>:

<div class="table-container"><table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>en</th>
<th>gloss</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>limb/arm/leg/hand</td>
<td><span class="gloss">arm</span></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>hand (arm-end)</td>
<td><span class="gloss">arm-end</span></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>leg (go-arm)</td>
<td><span class="gloss">go-arm</span></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>foot (leg-end)</td>
<td><span class="gloss">go-arm-end</span></td>
</tr>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table></div>


<b>Note to English speakers:</b> A good number of the world's languages, e.g. Greek and Chinese, do not differentiate "hand" and "arm". So this level of ambiguity is quite natural!
