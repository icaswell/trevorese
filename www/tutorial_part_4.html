You may have noticed this already, but in Trevorese, most words are nouns. A verb is just “doing” a noun, and an adjective is just being “like” a noun. Therefore, there are only the following parts of speech:

<ol>
<li>nouns (and pronouns)
    <ol type="a">
<li>verbs: “do noun”</li>
<li> modals: like verbs</li>
<li> conjunctions: noun placed before clause</li>
<li> prepositions: nouns placed before other nouns</li>
<li> quantifiers: special nouns placed before other nouns (this/that/etc, “more”, “sixty-seven”…)</li>
</ol>

<li>Special markers: “do”, “like”

<div class="section-h3"><div class="collapsible-header">Other tenses with special Adverbs</div><div class="collapsible-content">
The second important subtlety to using verbs well is adverbs. Let’s introduce a few very important adverbs:

<div class="table-container"><table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>en</th>
<th>gloss</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>usually</td>
<td><span class="gloss">big-number-time</span></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>ever</td>
<td><span class="gloss">number-time</span></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>already</td>
<td><span class="gloss">back</span></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>just</td>
<td><span class="gloss">self</span></td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table></div>



These allow us to express other tenses in various languages. Let’s look at them one-by-one:

<span class="gloss">number-time</span> is used for any habitual action: just use it as an adverb modifying the verb, e.g. &lt;you normally go&gt; “<span class="gloss">you</span> <span class="gloss">do</span> <span class="gloss">go</span> <span class="gloss">like</span> <span class="gloss">number-time</span>”. In English, this is expressed with “used to” in the past tense, by the simple present tense or “usually” in the present, and by the progressive “-ing” in in the future:
<div class="table-container"><table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>en</th>
<th>gloss</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>I am walking to school</td>
<td><span class="gloss">I</span> <span class="gloss">do</span> <span class="gloss">go-arm-go</span> <span class="gloss">direction</span> <span class="gloss">get-think-place</span></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>I [usually] walk to school</td>
<td><span class="gloss">I</span> <span class="gloss">do</span> <span class="gloss">go-arm-go</span> <span class="gloss">like</span> <span class="gloss">number-time</span> <span class="gloss">direction</span> <span class="gloss">get-think-place</span></td>

</tr>
</tbody>
</table></div><span class="gloss">self</span> is used exactly as the English “just”, to express a time very close to the present. However, English needs a lot of extra words to express this when combined with different tenses:
<div class="table-container"><table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>en</th>
<th>gloss</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>I just walked to school</td>
<td><span class="gloss">I</span> <span class="gloss">back</span> <span class="gloss">do</span> <span class="gloss">go-arm-go</span> <span class="gloss">like</span> <span class="gloss">swa</span> <span class="gloss">direction</span> <span class="gloss">get-think-place</span></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>I am just now walking to school</td>
<td><span class="gloss">I</span> <span class="gloss">do</span> <span class="gloss">go-arm-go</span> <span class="gloss">like</span> <span class="gloss">just</span> <span class="gloss">direction</span> <span class="gloss">get-think-place</span></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>I am just about to walk to school</td>
<td><span class="gloss">I</span> <span class="gloss">do</span> <span class="gloss">go-arm-go</span> <span class="gloss">like</span> <span class="gloss">just</span> <span class="gloss">direction</span> <span class="gloss">get-think-place</span></td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table></div>



English has a tense called the perfect (“have”)<sup><a href="#fn:1" id="fnref:1">1</a></sup>, as in the sentence “I have been to Germany” or “More people have been to Berlin than me”. All this is really conveying is that the action has, indeed, happened at least once, and likely many times, in contrast to a statement like “I went to Germany”, which just means you went a particular time. So in effect, the perfect is just saying that you went some time(s).

At this point we introduce the Trevorese word <span class="gloss">time</span>:<div class="table-container"><table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>en</th>
<th>gloss</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>I fell</td>
<td><span class="gloss">I</span> <span class="gloss">back</span> <span class="gloss">do</span> <span class="gloss">down</span></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>I fell once</td>
<td><span class="gloss">I</span> <span class="gloss">back</span> <span class="gloss">do</span> <span class="gloss">down</span> <span class="gloss">like</span> <span class="gloss">one</span> <span class="gloss">times</span></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>I fell twice</td>
<td><span class="gloss">I</span> <span class="gloss">back</span> <span class="gloss">do</span> <span class="gloss">down</span> <span class="gloss">like</span> <span class="gloss">two</span> <span class="gloss">times</span></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>I fell 67 times</td>
<td><span class="gloss">I</span> <span class="gloss">back</span> <span class="gloss">do</span> <span class="gloss">down</span> <span class="gloss">like</span> <span class="gloss">six-seven</span> <span class="gloss">times</span></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>I fell several times</td>
<td><span class="gloss">I</span> <span class="gloss">back</span> <span class="gloss">do</span> <span class="gloss">down</span> <span class="gloss">like</span> <span class="gloss">number</span> <span class="gloss">times</span></td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table></div>



If you use times without any quantifier, it just means “one or more times”:
<div class="table-container"><table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>en</th>
<th>gloss</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>I fell some number of times</td>
<td><span class="gloss">I</span> <span class="gloss">back</span> <span class="gloss">do</span> <span class="gloss">down</span> <span class="gloss">like</span> <span class="gloss">times</span></td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table></div>


However, English has a different way of expressing this: the perfect tense! Hence:
<div class="table-container"><table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>en</th>
<th>gloss</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>I have fallen</td>
<td><span class="gloss">I</span> <span class="gloss">back</span> <span class="gloss">do</span> <span class="gloss">down</span> <span class="gloss-emph">like</span> <span class="gloss-emph">times</span></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>I have walked to school</td>
<td><span class="gloss">I</span> <span class="gloss">back</span> <span class="gloss">do</span> <span class="gloss">go-arm-go</span> <span class="gloss-emph">like</span> <span class="gloss-emph">times</span> <span class="gloss">direction</span> <span class="gloss">get-think-place</span></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>I have walked to school twice</td>
<td><span class="gloss">I</span> <span class="gloss">back</span> <span class="gloss">do</span> <span class="gloss">go-arm-go</span> <span class="gloss-emph">like</span> <span class="gloss-emph">two</span> <span class="gloss-emph">times</span> <span class="gloss">direction</span> <span class="gloss">get-think-place</span></td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table></div>

TODO have i accidentally collapsed pluperfect into past? in any case the explanation is outdated.

English also has the curiously named tense, the pluperfect (the “had verbed” tense). This is specifically used for things that happened in the past and were already completed before another thing happened in the past — it’s kind of like “the past with respect to the past”. However, there is also a much simpler way of expressing the same thing in English: “already”. Trevorese takes this approach, with <span class="gloss">back</span>:<div class="table-container"><table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>en</th>
<th>gloss</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>I had walked to school, but he didn’t know</td>
<td><span class="gloss">I</span> <span class="gloss">back</span> <span class="gloss">do</span> <span class="gloss">go-arm-go</span> <span class="gloss">to</span> <span class="gloss">get-think-place</span>, <span class="gloss">against</span> <span class="gloss">this</span> <span class="gloss">not</span> <span class="gloss">do</span> <span class="gloss">hard-think</span></td>

</div></div>
<div class="section-h3"><div class="collapsible-header">Future Perfect Tense</div><div class="collapsible-content">
The future perfect tense, or “past within future”, is a feature of Indo-European languages that occurs in dependent clauses. In Trevorese, it is simply expressed with the past:
<div class="table-container"><table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>en</th>
<th>gloss</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>Next year we <b>will have bought</b> two dogs</td>
<td>&lt;Next year we did buy two dogs&gt; <br/> <span class="gloss">year</span> <span class="gloss">like</span> <span class="gloss">front</span> <span class="gloss">me-number</span> <span class="gloss-emph">back</span> <span class="gloss-emph">do</span> <span class="gloss-emph">metal</span> <span class="gloss">two</span> <span class="gloss">of-back-go-animal</span></td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table></div>



The context makes it clear that this “we did buy two dogs” is happening relative to the future, i.e. “next year”. Conversely, one can just as easily form the “future within past” tense!
<div class="table-container"><table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>en</th>
<th>gloss</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>Last year we <b>were going to buy</b> two dogs</td>
<td>&lt;Last year we will buy two dogs&gt; <span class="gloss">year</span> <span class="gloss">like</span> <span class="gloss">last</span> <span class="gloss">number</span> <span class="gloss">me</span> <span class="gloss-emph">will</span> <span class="gloss-emph">buy</span> <span class="gloss">two</span> <span class="gloss">of-back-go-animal</span></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>He said that he <b>would sing</b></td>
<td>&lt;He said he will sing &gt; <br/> <span class="gloss">this</span> <span class="gloss">back</span> <span class="gloss">do</span> <span class="gloss">say</span> <span class="gloss">this</span> <span class="gloss-emph">will</span> <span class="gloss-emph">sing</span></td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table></div>



The future-within-past in English has to be expressed with this rather cumbersome “were going to” construction, or the verb “would” which is ambiguous because “would” also has the separate meaning of the conditional mode.

Als please consider this sentence:

Next year we were going to buy two dogs, but we decided not to


</div></div>
<div class="section-h3"><div class="collapsible-header">Past participles</div><div class="collapsible-content">
The past participle in English expresses that a verb happened to some noun. It is a special way of making a verb into an adjective. In many cases, this is TODO TODO
<ul><li>me like stress</li><li>situation like stress</li><li>apple like fall</li><li>apple like eat like half</li></ul>
In Trevorese, this is treated no differently than any other adjective phrase: it is accomplished by a like phrase with the past tense:
<div class="table-container"><table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>en</th>
<th>gloss</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>A <b>fallen</b> apple</td>
<td><span class="gloss">apple</span> <span class="gloss">like</span> <span class="gloss-emph">this</span> <span class="gloss-emph">back</span> <span class="gloss-emph">do</span> <span class="gloss-emph">down</span></td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table></div>



In English, past participles can also mean that “something did this”. In Trevorese, the construction is the same as before, but with a “<span class="gloss">some”:</span><div class="table-container"><table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>en</th>
<th>gloss</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>A <b>half-eaten</b> apple</td>
<td><span class="gloss">apple</span> <span class="gloss">like</span> [some] <span class="gloss">back</span> <span class="gloss">do</span> <span class="gloss">eat</span> <span class="gloss">half</span> [of <span class="gloss">this</span>]</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table></div>



The words in brackets are optional; as in most languages, they can be left out.

In English, past participles are a special construction only for the past participle of a verb. But in Trevorese, there is no difference between the past tense and other modals, so this same construction can be used for all the modals:
<div class="table-container"><table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>en</th>
<th>gloss</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>An apple that is about to fall</td>
<td><span class="gloss">apple</span> <span class="gloss">like</span> [this] <span class="gloss">will</span> <span class="gloss">down</span></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>An apple that is about to be eaten</td>
<td><span class="gloss">apple</span> <span class="gloss">like</span> [some] <span class="gloss">will</span> <span class="gloss">eat</span> [this]</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>An apple that can fall</td>
<td><span class="gloss">apple</span> <span class="gloss">like</span> [this] <span class="gloss">can</span> <span class="gloss">down</span></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>An edible apple</td>
<td><span class="gloss">apple</span> <span class="gloss">like</span> [some] <span class="gloss">can</span> <span class="gloss">eat</span> [this]</td>

<tr>
<td>An apple that may be edible</td>

Observe that English has all sorts of different constructions for these!

<div class="section-h3"><div class="collapsible-header">Counterfactuals</div><div class="collapsible-content"><h4>The Conditional and “if”</h4>
The conditional is a special tense (or “mood” if you’re a purist) that crops up in some languages.  It’s basically identical to talking about things that would happen. In English, it’s most noticeable when it changes “will” into “would”, meaning “will go, conditional on that first statement”.

This is simple enough in Trevorese: we just use case, which is identical to “if”. Essentially, it means “In the case that…”
<div class="table-container"><table>
<thead>

</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>[future] if he sings, I will hear him</td>
<td><span class="gloss-emph">case</span> <span class="gloss">this</span> <span class="gloss-emph">front</span> <span class="gloss-emph">do</span> <span class="gloss">sing</span>, <span class="gloss">me</span> <span class="gloss-emph">front</span> <span class="gloss-emph">do</span> <span class="gloss">sound-see</span> <span class="gloss">this</span></td>

</tr>
</tbody>
</table></div>


Note: the “sing” in  “if you sing, I will hear you”, even though it looks like the present tense, is actually in the future. Trevorese treats it as such.

<h4>The Subjunctive</h4>
The subjunctive happens when there is something that is happening counterfactually. For instance, in none of the sentences “If you were to come”, “If you had come”, and “I hope you come” did you actually come. Many languages, for instance Indo-European languages, have all sorts of complex ways of dealing with this situation. Trevorese, like Chinese, Telugu, Toki Pona, and so on, sidesteps this and leaves them ambiguous:


<div class="table-container"><table border="1">
<thead>
<tr><th>en</th><th>gloss</th></tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr><td>[future] if he sings, I will hear him<br/>[future subj.] if he were to sing, I would hear him<br/>deleteme<br/>deleteme</td><td> <span class="gloss-emph">case</span> <span class="gloss">this</span> <span class="gloss-emph">front</span> <span class="gloss-emph">do</span> <span class="gloss">sing</span>, <span class="gloss">me</span> <span class="gloss-emph">front</span> <span class="gloss-emph">do</span> <span class="gloss">sound-see</span> <span class="gloss">this</span></td></tr>
<tr><td>[present] if he is singing, I hear him<br/>[present subj.] if he were singing, I would hear him<br/>deleteme<br/>deleteme</td><td> <span class="gloss-emph">case</span> <span class="gloss">this</span> <span class="gloss-emph">do</span> <span class="gloss">sing</span>, <span class="gloss">me</span> <span class="gloss-emph">do</span> <span class="gloss">sound-see</span> <span class="gloss">this</span></td></tr>
<tr><td>[past] if he was singing, I heard him<br/>[past subj.] if he had been singing, I would have heard him<br/>[past subj.] if he had sung, I would have heard him<br/>[past subj.] if he would of sung, I would have heard him</td><td><span class="gloss-emph">case</span> <span class="gloss">this</span> <span class="gloss-emph">back</span> <span class="gloss-emph">do</span> <span class="gloss">sing</span>, <span class="gloss">me</span> <span class="gloss-emph">back</span> <span class="gloss-emph">do</span> <span class="gloss">sound-see</span> <span class="gloss">this</span></td></tr>
</tbody>
</table></div>






Note that the second part of the clause would be, in English, in the conditional. Conditional and subjunctive go together like bread and butter! But as we already established, there is no conditional in Trevorese, so the second half of the clause is just in normal indicative.

Now, in some cases, the fact that the subjunctive and the indicative are the same may be annoying. The default interpretation is that we are talking about a subjunctive event. If we really need to clarify, we can add “in fact” to be clear that the statement is in the indicative:
<div class="table-container"><table border="1">
<thead>
<tr><th>en</th><th>gloss</th></tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr><td>[past] if he was singing, I heard him<br/>[past subj.] if he had been singing, I would have heard him</td><td><span class="gloss">case</span> <span class="gloss">this</span> <span class="gloss">back</span> <span class="gloss">do</span> <span class="gloss">sing</span>, <span class="gloss">me</span> <span class="gloss">back</span> <span class="gloss">do</span> <span class="gloss">sound-see</span> <span class="gloss">this</span></td></tr>

</table></div>
</div></div>
<div class="section-h3"><div class="collapsible-header">“It”: Passive voice</div><div class="collapsible-content">
German uses even more “it: than English, e.g. “It gonged”, “It is whispered in the ear”. Irish has its own conjugation, e.g. “déartear” – it is said.

The passive is a somewhat unusual construction that crops up in some form or other in many languages. It can either be used to omit a subject, or to take responsibility away from them. Let’s look at the first example first.

Any language needs some way to have sentences that don’t have a clear subject. Consider the following sentence:

the milk was spilled

All this is saying is that someone or something spilled the milk, but the speaker is not saying who. Fortunately, Trevorese has a pronoun for someone or something: <span class="gloss">some.</span> Therefore, the passive can be expressed much more simply than in English:

<div class="table-container"><table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>en</th>
<th>gloss</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>the milk was spilled</td>
<td><span class="gloss">some</span> <span class="gloss">back</span> <span class="gloss">do</span> <span class="gloss">spill</span> <span class="gloss">milk</span></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>someone or something spilled the milk</td>
<td><span class="gloss">some</span> <span class="gloss">back</span> <span class="gloss">do</span> <span class="gloss">spill</span> <span class="gloss">milk</span></td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table></div>



Note English expresses this in the exact same way, if you care to express whether the doer was animate or inanimate, i.e. whether it was a person or thing. (TODO link that other chapter.) The same can be done in Trevorese:
<div class="table-container"><table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>en</th>
<th>gloss</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>someone spilled the milk</td>
<td><span class="gloss">some</span> <span class="gloss">person</span> <span class="gloss">back</span> <span class="gloss">do</span> <span class="gloss">spill</span> <span class="gloss">milk</span></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>something spilled the milk</td>
<td><span class="gloss">some</span> <span class="gloss">thing</span> <span class="gloss">back</span> <span class="gloss">do</span> <span class="gloss">spill</span> <span class="gloss">milk</span></td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table></div>



Now, what about the version of the passive that has a subject attached to it?

<ul><li>the milk was spilled by Fred</li></ul>
The only difference between this and the active voice is that it takes some responsibility away from Fred. This distinction doesn’t add much to the expressivity of the language, and can safely be removed. As such, Trevorese just uses the active voice in these constructions:

<div class="table-container"><table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>en</th>
<th>gloss</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>the milk was spilled by Fred</td>
<td><span class="gloss">Fred</span> <span class="gloss">back</span> <span class="gloss">do</span> <span class="gloss">spill</span> <span class="gloss">cow-water</span></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Fred spilled the milk</td>
<td><span class="gloss">Fred</span> <span class="gloss">back</span> <span class="gloss">do</span> <span class="gloss">spill</span> <span class="gloss">cow-water</span></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Who was the milk spilled by?</td>
<td><span class="gloss">what</span> <span class="gloss">person</span> <span class="gloss">back</span> <span class="gloss">do</span> <span class="gloss">spill</span> <span class="gloss">cow-water</span>?</td>

<tr>

</tr>
<tr>
<td> <span class="wrong"> *It is calling someone my name </span> </td>
<td><span class="gloss">some</span> <span class="gloss">person</span> <span class="gloss">do</span> <span class="gloss">call</span> <span class="gloss">name</span> <span class="gloss">of</span> <span class="gloss">me</span></td>

<tr>
<td>Her nose likes being kissed</td>

</tr>
</tbody>
</table></div>



This last sentence is not grammatical in English, but it is normal in German!



</div></div>
<div class="section-h3"><div class="collapsible-header">“It”: Impersonal Aspect</div><div class="collapsible-content">
    Similar to the passive, the impersonal aspect is another way to avoid saying the subject. This comes up when there isn’t a subject, for instance for weather. With it is raining or it is dark, there is not really anything that the it refers to, excepting perhaps the universe itself. The only reason that “it” is added is because the grammar of the language demands some subject for the verb. In a language like Spanish, where subjects are not necessary, the subject is simply omitted: llueve means it rains. You can’t say  <span class="wrong">*él llueve</span> or something like that. Hebrew is the same (pro-drop).

Although grammarians tend to think of the impersonal aspect as different from the passive voice, the authors of this work contend that they are actually the same. The only difference is that for the impersonal aspect, one is forced to omit the subject because there isn’t a subject, whereas for the passive, you choose to, because you don’t know who the subject is (or don’t want to say).

What do we do in Trevorese? We just use <span class="gloss">this,</span> in the sense of “this all is raining”. You can think of this use of “this” as someone gesturing in front of them and saying “all of this”.

<td>&lt;this is doing dark&gt;<br/>  <span class="gloss">this</span> <span class="gloss">do</span> <span class="gloss">dark</span></td>

This last sentence is not grammatical in English, but it is normal in German!

Impersonal with adjective:
<div class="table-container"><table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>en</th>
<th>gloss</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>It is dark</td>
<td>&lt;this is dark&gt;<br/>  <span class="gloss">this</span> <span class="gloss">like</span> <span class="gloss">dark</span></td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table></div>



In some cases, using <span class="gloss">this</span> may seem ambiguous, if there is already another <span class="gloss">this</span> in the sentence, for instance a person. For instance, imagine we are talking about some guy:

<div class="table-container"><table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>en</th>
<th>gloss</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>He walked into the room. It was dark.</td>
<td>&lt;this walked into room. this is dark&gt;</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>It was raining as he walked.</td>
<td>&lt;this was raining as this walked.&gt;</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table></div><div class="table-container"><table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>en</th>
<th>gloss</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>It walked into the room. It was dark.</td>
<td>&lt;this walked into room. this is dark&gt;</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>It was raining as it walked.</td>
<td>&lt;this was raining as this walked.&gt;</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table></div><h4>There is / there are</h4>
“There is” is expressed just like the other impersonal pronouns, as “this do be”:
<div class="table-container"><table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>en</th>
<th>gloss</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>There are a lot of people in the mall</td>
<td><span class="gloss">this</span> <span class="gloss">do</span> <span class="gloss">be</span> <span class="gloss">big-number</span> <span class="gloss">person</span> <span class="gloss">in</span> <span class="gloss">mall</span></td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
  <div class="footnotes">
    <hr>
    <h4>Footnotes</h4>
    <ol>
      <li id="fn:1">Most Indo-European languages have this, but it has different meanings in them, leading to confusion for learners. In Spanish, "he comido" carries the connotation that it just happened, and in German it is the default past tense, so "Ich bin gelaufen" just means "I ran". <a href="#fnref:1" title="Jump back to footnote 1 in the text">↩</a></li>
