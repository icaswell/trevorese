<div class="section-h2"><div class="collapsible-header">The Trevorese Word</div><div class="collapsible-content">
<div class="section-h3"><div class="collapsible-header">Sounds</div><div class="collapsible-content">
Each Trevorese syllable has the form CV[N], where C is a consonant, V is a vowel, and N is the sound “ng”.
<h4>Vowels</h4>
Trevorese has the five cardinal vowels <b>/aiuoe/</b>, as well as three diphthongs <b>/ai/</b>,<b>/au/</b>, and <b>/oi/</b>, which are pronounced exactly like the combination of the two vowels they are made of.
<h4>Consonants</h4>
Trevorese has 12 simple consonants, <b>/w/</b>,<b>/y/</b>,<b>/m/</b>,<b>/b/</b>,<b>/g/</b>,<b>/d/</b>,<b>/n/</b>,<b>/s/</b>,<b>/p/</b>,<b>/k/</b>,<b>/t/</b>,<b>/l/</b> and 11 compound consonants, <b>/ny/</b>,<b>/mw/</b>,<b>/bw/</b>,<b>/gw/</b>,<b>/dw/</b>,<b>/sw/</b>,<b>/pw/</b>,<b>/kw/</b>,<b>/tw/</b>. The compound consonants are pronounced exactly like the combination of their two constituents, e.g. /<b>k</b>ik/ sounds like “<b>k</b>ick” and /<b>kw</b>ik/ sounds like “<b>qu</b>ick”.
<h4>Phonotactics</h4>
A variety of possible syllables are never used by Trevorese, as they are deemed too easy to mistake with other syllables. For example, <span class="wrong">*nyi</span> and <span class="wrong">*yi</span> are too easy to mistake for <span class="surface">ni</span> and <span class="surface">i</span>, respectively. Diphthongs plus nasal coda, like <span class="wrong">*bwaing</span> or <span class="wrong">*saung</span>, are forbidden as they are deemed too hard to pronounce.
</div></div>
<div class="section-h3"><div class="collapsible-header">Atoms</div><div class="collapsible-content">
There are under 200 basic words from which all other words are built. These are called atoms. They all have the form consonant+vowel[+optional ng]. The simplest atom would simply have consonant+vowel, e.g. <span class="surface">ma</span>, or <span class="surface">su</span>. Atoms representing slightly more complex concepts use more use of compound consonants, diphthongs, and the nasal coda, e.g. <span class="surface">yau</span>, <span class="surface">kwe</span>, or <span class="surface">nang</span>.

There are six special atoms that start with a vowel, representing the most basic concepts of <span class="gloss">this</span>, <span class="gloss">that</span>, <span class="gloss">all</span>, <span class="gloss">what</span>, and <span class="gloss">foreign_marker</span>. These are usually not used in compound words.
</div></div>
<div class="section-h3"><div class="collapsible-header">Compounds</div><div class="collapsible-content">
Most words in Trevorese are compounds, composed of multiple syllables. It is always unambiguous what atoms a compound is made of. Here are some examples:

<div class="table-container"><table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>en</th>
<th>gloss</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>of/from</td>
<td><span class="gloss">of</span></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>from the back</td>
<td><span class="gloss">of-back</span></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>to follow (go from the back)</td>
<td><span class="gloss">of-back-go</span></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>dog (a following/loyal animal)</td>
<td><span class="gloss">of-back-go-animal</span></td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table></div>



If the compound is on the longer side, it can be written with a hyphen to show the etymology better:

<div class="table-container"><table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>en</th>
<th>gloss</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>dog</td>
<td><span class="gloss">of-back-go</span></td>

The following introduces <span class="english">English,</span><span class="gloss">Gloss,</span> and <span class="surface">Trevorese</span> forms. The gloss is just Trevorese using (approximate) English words, so it is easier to see exactly what’s going on. There may also be some loose literal translations in &lt; angle brackets &gt;. These are loose translations of the Trevorese into English so you can understand more or less how the construction words. For instance:

<ul>
<li>English: <span class="english">I saw the black cat</span></li>
<li>Loose translation:  &lt;I did see the cat like blackness &gt; </li>
<li>gloss: <span class="gloss">me back do see cat like dark-color</span></li>
<li>Trevorese: <span class="surface">mi ya du si mau se nobailang</span></li>
</ul>
<div class="section-h3"><div class="collapsible-header">Nouns</div><div class="collapsible-content">

There is no distinction between <span class="english">a</span> and <span class="english">the.</span> Therefore:
<div class="table-container"><table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>en</th>
<th>gloss</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>cat</td>
<td><span class="gloss">cat</span></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>a cat</td>
<td><span class="gloss">cat</span></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>the cat</td>
<td><span class="gloss">cat</span></td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table></div>



If you want to specify a particular one, you can use quantifiers like <span class="gloss">this</span>, <span class="gloss">what</span>, and <span class="gloss">what</span>:<div class="table-container"><table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>en</th>
<th>gloss</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>this cat</td>
<td><span class="gloss">this</span> <span class="gloss">cat</span></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>that cat</td>
<td><span class="gloss">that</span> <span class="gloss">cat</span></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>what cat?</td>
<td><span class="gloss">what</span> <span class="gloss">cat</span>?</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table></div>



Now let’s introduce a simple verb: <span class="gloss">be</span>. For any verb in the present tense, you need to use the word <span class="gloss">do</span> to mark that it is a verb:
<div class="table-container"><table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>en</th>
<th>gloss</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>this cat <b>is</b> a friend</td>
<td><span class="gloss">this</span> <span class="gloss">cat</span> <span class="gloss-emph">do</span> <span class="gloss-emph">be</span> <span class="gloss">love-person</span></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>a dog <b>is</b> an animal</td>
<td><span class="gloss">dog</span> <span class="gloss-emph">do</span> <span class="gloss-emph">be</span> <span class="gloss">person</span></td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table></div>



To negate this, just add <span class="gloss">no</span> right before the verb:

<div class="table-container"><table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>en</th>
<th>gloss</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>that cat <b>is not<b></b> a friend</b></td>
<td><span class="gloss">that</span> <span class="gloss">cat</span> <span class="gloss-emph">no</span> <span class="gloss-emph">do</span> <span class="gloss-emph">be</span> <span class="gloss">love-person</span></td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table></div>
</div></div>
<div class="section-h3"><div class="collapsible-header">Plurals</div><div class="collapsible-content">
You may notice that in the previous examples, the word for <span class="english">cats</span> was the same as the word for <span class="english">cat.</span> In Trevorese, the plural looks the same as the singular! If you speak a European language, you may think this will cause ambiguity. However, usually the quantifier makes it unambiguous as to whether the noun is plural or not. For instance, with a quantifier like <span class="english">many</span> or <span class="english">sixty-seven</span>, you already know that the noun following it is plural.  This said, there are a few examples of when context alone is not enough to determine whether something is plural. For example, consider the sentence <span class="english">I was trying to sleep when I heard some cat meow</span> vs <span class="english">I was trying to sleep when I heard some <b>cats</b> meow</span>; or  <span class="english">this cat is chonky</span> vs <span class="english"><b>these</b> <b>cats</b> are chonky</span>.

In these cases, you can use the word <span class="gloss">number</span> to mark the plural:
<div class="table-container"><table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>en</th>
<th>gloss</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>A dog</td>
<td><span class="gloss">dog</span></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>dog<b>s</b> [two or more]</td>
<td><span class="gloss-emph">number</span> <span class="gloss">dog</span></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>that dog is a friend</td>
<td><span class="gloss">that</span> <span class="gloss">dog</span> <span class="gloss">do</span> <span class="gloss">be</span> <span class="gloss">love-person</span></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><b>those</b> dogs are friends</td>
<td><span class="gloss-emph">that</span> <span class="gloss">number</span> <span class="gloss">dog</span> <span class="gloss">do</span> <span class="gloss">be</span> <span class="gloss">love-person</span></td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table></div>



Literally, this just means “group”. It goes before the noun, because it is a quantifier, just like <span class="gloss">this</span> or <span class="gloss">that</span>.
</div></div>
<div class="section-h3"><div class="collapsible-header">Adjectives 1</div><div class="collapsible-content">
Let’s look at some <b>modifiers,</b> aka adjectives/adverbs. In Trevorese, there is no difference between nouns and adjectives! You just say that a noun is “like'” another noun with <span class="gloss">like</span>:<div class="table-container"><table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>en</th>
<th>gloss</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>the cat</td>
<td><span class="gloss">cat</span></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>the black cat</td>
<td><span class="gloss">cat</span> <span class="gloss-emph">like</span> <span class="gloss">dark-color</span></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>the cat is black</td>
<td><span class="gloss">cat</span> <span class="gloss-emph">like</span> <span class="gloss">dark-color</span></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>the cat is talkative</td>
<td><span class="gloss">cat</span> <span class="gloss-emph">like</span> <span class="gloss">talk</span></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>this cat is friendly</td>
<td><span class="gloss">this</span> <span class="gloss">cat</span> <span class="gloss-emph">like</span> <span class="gloss">love-being</span></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>that cat is not friendly</td>
<td><span class="gloss">this</span> <span class="gloss">cat</span> <span class="gloss-emph">no</span> <span class="gloss-emph">like</span> <span class="gloss">love-being</span></td>

<tr>
<td>what dog is cat-like?</td>
<td><span class="gloss">what</span> <span class="gloss">dog</span> <span class="gloss-emph">like</span> <span class="gloss">cat</span>?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>those dogs friendly</td>
<td><span class="gloss">that</span> <span class="gloss">number</span> <span class="gloss">dog</span> <span class="gloss-emph">like</span> <span class="gloss">love-being</span></td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table></div>



Another way of thinking about <span class="gloss">like</span> is <span class="english">that’s:</span> “the black cat” is expressed as &lt;the cat <b>that’s</b> black&gt;.

With multiple adjectives, put a <span class="gloss">like</span> before each one:
<div class="table-container"><table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>en</th>
<th>gloss</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>this cat <b>is friendly, talkative, and doglike</b></td>
<td><span class="gloss">this</span> <span class="gloss">cat</span> <span class="gloss-emph">like</span> <span class="gloss-emph">love-person</span> <span class="gloss-emph">like</span> <span class="gloss-emph">talk</span>, <span class="gloss-emph">like</span> <span class="gloss-emph">dog</span></td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table></div>
</div></div>
<div class="section-h3"><div class="collapsible-header">Verbs 1</div><div class="collapsible-content">
We already saw the verb <span class="gloss">do be</span>. Let’s talk more about verbs. There are not truly verbs in this language; you can just “do” a noun. Just like in English, you can substitute <span class="english">I squat</span> with <span class="english">I do a squat</span>, or <span class="english">I boop</span> with <span class="english">I do a boop</span>:

<div class="table-container"><table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>en</th>
<th>gloss</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>the cat <b>is talking</b></td>
<td><span class="gloss">cat</span> <span class="gloss-emph">do</span> <span class="gloss-emph">talk</span></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>the cat <b>is not talking</b></td>
<td><span class="gloss">cat</span> <span class="gloss-emph">no</span> <span class="gloss-emph">do</span> <span class="gloss-emph">talk</span></td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table></div>



While we’re at it, let’s learn the tenses. In Trevorese, there are three basic tenses: past, present, and future. They are expressed with <span class="gloss">back</span>, <span class="gloss">do</span>, and <span class="gloss">front</span>:<div class="table-container"><table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>en</th>
<th>gloss</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>the cat <b>talked</b></td>
<td><span class="gloss">cat</span> <span class="gloss">back</span> <span class="gloss-emph">do</span> <span class="gloss-emph">talk</span></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>the cat <b>is talking</b> / the cat <b>talks</b></td>
<td><span class="gloss">cat</span> <span class="gloss-emph">do</span> <span class="gloss-emph">talk</span></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>the cat <b>will talk</b></td>
<td><span class="gloss">cat</span> <span class="gloss-emph">front</span> <span class="gloss-emph">do</span> <span class="gloss-emph">talk</span></td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table></div>



Past, present, future – that’s it!

Now that we can form a full sentence, let’s go back to adjectives. Adjectives go after the thing they modify:
<div class="table-container"><table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>en</th>
<th>gloss</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>the friendly cat is talking</td>
<td><span class="gloss">cat</span> <span class="gloss">like</span> <span class="gloss">good-person</span> <span class="gloss">do</span> <span class="gloss">talk</span></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>the cat is talking <b>friendlily/in a friendly way</b></td>
<td><span class="gloss">cat</span> <span class="gloss">do</span> <span class="gloss">talk</span> <span class="gloss-emph">like</span> <span class="gloss-emph">good-person</span></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>that cat is talking <b>unfriendlily</b></td>
<td><span class="gloss">cat</span> <span class="gloss">do</span> <span class="gloss">talk</span> <span class="gloss-emph">like</span> <span class="gloss-emph">no</span> <span class="gloss-emph">good-person</span></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>the <b>black</b> dog is talking <b>in a friendly, cat-like way</b></td>
<td><span class="gloss">dog</span> <span class="gloss-emph">like</span> <span class="gloss-emph">dark-color</span> <span class="gloss">do</span> <span class="gloss">talk</span> <span class="gloss-emph">like</span> <span class="gloss-emph">good-person</span> <span class="gloss-emph">like</span> <span class="gloss-emph">cat</span></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>he sings <b>sweetly, like a small bird</b></td>
<td><span class="gloss">this</span> <span class="gloss">do</span> <span class="gloss">good-sound</span> <span class="gloss-emph">like</span> <span class="gloss-emph">sugar</span>, <span class="gloss-emph">like</span> <span class="gloss-emph">air-animal</span> <span class="gloss-emph">like</span> <span class="gloss-emph">small</span></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>he spoke to me <b>like a child</b></td>
<td><span class="gloss">this</span> <span class="gloss">back</span> <span class="gloss">do</span> <span class="gloss">talk</span> <span class="gloss">me</span> <span class="gloss-emph">like</span> <span class="gloss-emph">small-person</span></td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table></div>


Notes:
the penultimate sentence is somewhat ambiguous in Trevorese, but contextually it’s clear.
the last sentence is ambiguous in English and Trevorese both.

</div></div>
<div class="section-h3"><div class="collapsible-header">Pronouns</div><div class="collapsible-content">
At this point we can talk about pronouns:
<div class="table-container"><table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>en</th>
<th>gloss</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>I / me</td>
<td><span class="gloss">me</span></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>you</td>
<td><span class="gloss">you</span></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>he / she / him / her / it</td>
<td><span class="gloss">this</span></td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table></div>



The plural forms of these are formed with <span class="gloss">number</span>, just like the plural of a noun:
<div class="table-container"><table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>en</th>
<th>gloss</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>we / us</td>
<td><span class="gloss-emph">number</span> <span class="gloss">me</span></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>you all</td>
<td><span class="gloss-emph">number</span> <span class="gloss">you</span></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>they / them</td>
<td><span class="gloss-emph">number</span> <span class="gloss">this</span></td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table></div>



Here are examples using them in sentences:
<div class="table-container"><table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>en</th>
<th>gloss</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td><b>I</b> am a cat</td>
<td><span class="gloss-emph">me</span> <span class="gloss">do</span> <span class="gloss">be</span> <span class="gloss">cat</span></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><b>I</b> am black</td>
<td><span class="gloss-emph">me</span> <span class="gloss">like</span> <span class="gloss">dark-color</span></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><b>I</b> am talking</td>
<td><span class="gloss-emph">me</span> <span class="gloss">do</span> <span class="gloss">talk</span></td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table></div>



You may notice that <span class="gloss">this</span> means both he / she, as well as “this”! Therefore, the following are all valid translations, and need context to tell apart:
<div class="table-container"><table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>en</th>
<th>gloss</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td><b>he</b> is a black cat</td>
<td><span class="gloss-emph">this</span> <span class="gloss">do</span> <span class="gloss">be</span> <span class="gloss">cat</span> <span class="gloss">like</span> <span class="gloss">dark-color</span></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><b>she</b> is a black cat</td>
<td><span class="gloss-emph">this</span> <span class="gloss">do</span> <span class="gloss">be</span> <span class="gloss">cat</span> <span class="gloss">like</span> <span class="gloss">dark-color</span></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><b>this</b> is a black cat</td>
<td><span class="gloss-emph">this</span> <span class="gloss">do</span> <span class="gloss">be</span> <span class="gloss">cat</span> <span class="gloss">like</span> <span class="gloss">dark-color</span></td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table></div>


Similarly, these two sentences are the same in Trevorese:
<div class="table-container"><table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>en</th>
<th>gloss</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>this cat is black</td>
<td><span class="gloss">this</span> <span class="gloss">cat</span> <span class="gloss">like</span> <span class="gloss">dark-color</span></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>this black cat</td>
<td><span class="gloss">this</span> <span class="gloss">cat</span> <span class="gloss">like</span> <span class="gloss">dark-color</span></td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table></div>
</div></div>
<div class="section-h3"><div class="collapsible-header">“Thing”</div><div class="collapsible-content">
Any verb, noun, or adjective can be replaced with “thing” if the context is clear. For instance:
<ul>
<li><span class="english">We were thinging football</span></li>
<li><span class="english">I didn’t hear the thing you just thinged</span></li>
</ul>
</div></div>
<div class="section-h3"><div class="collapsible-header">Prepositions</div><div class="collapsible-content">
Prepositions are words that say how two things are related. For instance, you can say that the dog is <span class="english">behind</span> the cat, <span class="english">over</span> the cat, <span class="english">in</span> the cat, <span class="english">for</span> the cat; or that it is woofing <span class="english">at</span> the cat, or <span class="english">with</span> the cat, or <span class="english">by</span> the cat.

There are no true prepositions in Trevorese – everything is ultimately a noun. When you would use a preposition to describe where something is in English, just use the noun for corresponding location in Trevorese. If a dog is <span class="english">on</span> the roof, you say that the dog is <span class="gloss">surface</span> the roof. If you are going <span class="english">to</span> the store, you are going <span class="gloss">direction</span> the store; and if you are going <span class="english">from</span> the store, you are going <span class="gloss">of</span> the store. If the dog jumps <span class="english">onto</span> the roof, it jumps <span class="gloss">direction</span><span class="gloss">surface</span> the roof.

The following sections give details about how common prepositions are used.
<h4>Possession with “of”</h4>
Let’s start with <span class="gloss">of</span>, aka the word meaning <span class="english">belonging/possession</span>. This word indicates possession:

<div class="table-container"><table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>en</th>
<th>gloss</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>This is <b>my</b> dog</td>
<td><span class="gloss">this</span> <span class="gloss">do</span> <span class="gloss">be</span> <span class="gloss">dog</span> <span class="gloss-emph">of</span> <span class="gloss-emph">me</span></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>This is my dog<b>’s toy</b></td>
<td><span class="gloss">this</span> <span class="gloss">do</span> <span class="gloss">be</span> <span class="gloss">play-thing</span> <span class="gloss-emph">of</span> <span class="gloss-emph">dog</span> <span class="gloss">of</span> <span class="gloss">me</span></td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table></div>



The independent forms <span class="english">mine/yours/ours/hers/its/his/theirs</span> are handled simply by dropping the subject, as in Chinese:

<div class="table-container"><table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>en</th>
<th>gloss</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>This is <b>mine</b></td>
<td><span class="gloss">this</span> <span class="gloss">do</span> <span class="gloss">be</span> <span class="gloss-emph">of</span> <span class="gloss-emph">me</span></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>This is <b>my</b> dog. Where is <b>yours?</b></td>
<td><span class="gloss">this</span> <span class="gloss">dog</span> <span class="gloss">do</span> <span class="gloss">be</span> <span class="gloss-emph">of</span> <span class="gloss-emph">me</span>. <span class="gloss-emph">of</span> <span class="gloss-emph">you</span> <span class="gloss">what</span> <span class="gloss">place</span>?</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table></div><span class="gloss">of</span> can also mean “from”, as we will see in the next section.
<h4>Coexistence with “with”</h4>
The word <span class="gloss">with</span> is very straightforward. It is used just as <span class="english">with</span> or <span class="english">and</span> in English:
<div class="table-container"><table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>en</th>
<th>gloss</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>The person is <b>with</b> the cat</td>
<td><span class="gloss">person</span> <span class="gloss">do</span> <span class="gloss">be</span> <span class="gloss-emph">with</span> <span class="gloss">cat</span></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Come <b>with</b> me!</td>
<td><span class="gloss">you</span> <span class="gloss">do</span> <span class="gloss">go</span> <span class="gloss-emph">with</span> <span class="gloss">me</span> <span class="gloss">please</span>!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>I see a dog <b>and</b> a cat</td>
<td><span class="gloss">me</span> <span class="gloss">do</span> <span class="gloss">see</span> <span class="gloss">dog</span> <span class="gloss-emph">with</span> <span class="gloss">cat</span></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>he mixed water <b>with</b> soil</td>
<td><span class="gloss">this</span> <span class="gloss">back</span> <span class="gloss">do</span> <span class="gloss">with-do</span> <span class="gloss">water</span> <span class="gloss-emph">with</span> <span class="gloss">dirt</span></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>he mixed water <b>with</b> a stick</td>
<td><span class="gloss">this</span> <span class="gloss">back</span> <span class="gloss-emph">do</span> <span class="gloss-emph">use</span> <span class="gloss">stick</span> <span class="gloss">do</span> <span class="gloss">with-do</span> <span class="gloss">water</span></td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table></div>


Note that in the last example, the English “with” here is an instrumental marker in English, and actually a quite different meaning from the normal meaning. For the normal meaning of “with”, this would mean “He and a shovel were digging a hole”!

<h4>Basic Prepositions of movement</h4><div class="table-container"><table>

</table></div><h4>Spatial prepositions</h4>
English has a lot of prepositions for how two objects can be related. The snake can be <b>in front of</b> the dog, <b>near</b> the dog, <b>inside</b> the dog, <b>above</b> the dog, <b>on</b> the dog, or <b>by the side</b> of the dog. Some of these change if there is movement: for instance, after the snake goes <b>into</b> the dog it is <b>inside</b> the dog.

In Trevorese, these prepositions are simply expressed as one of the basic prepositions of movement (usually <span class="gloss">direction)</span> plus the location relative to the object. Let’s look at a few examples. In these examples, we’ll break them up by whether the movement is static (happening in one location), or as a movement to- or from that location:

</table></div><h4>Temporal prepositions</h4>
Prepositions of time are expressed with the same words as those of space. Imagine yourself as a box where the future stretches out in front of you and the past behind. Now imagine that you yourself are an event in time. You see another event in the future, in front of you. This event happens <b>after</b> you in time — so in this spatial metaphor, it happens <b>in front of</b> you. You happen <b>before</b> it — so, spatially, you happen <b>behind</b> it. Say there is another event that starts before you and ends after you. You happen <b>during</b> that event — spatially, you happen <b>in</b> it. And if you (the event) started at the same time as the other event and continue on forwards in time — aka you happen <b>since</b> that event — spatially,  you happen <b>starting</b> at that event.{{languages do this in a variety of ways. For instance, in English, you also see a timeline with the future stretching out in front of you, but the perspective is with respect to you, looking at two other events, rather than from the perspective of the event (grammatical subject) itself.  So if you see two events, the one that is closer to you happens before the one that is further away, which is why English “before” means “in front of”, rather than “behind”.}}


<h4>Prepositions in verb phrases</h4>
Many Indo-European verbs have prepositions built into them, and it causes considerable chaos for learners to master them. In Trevorese, these prepositions are generally absent:

<div class="table-container"><table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>en</th>
<th>gloss</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>I <b>worked on</b> a project</td>
<td><span class="gloss">me</span> <span class="gloss">back</span> <span class="gloss">do</span> <span class="gloss-emph">hard-do</span> <span class="gloss">project</span></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>What are you <b>talking about</b>?</td>
<td><span class="gloss">you</span> <span class="gloss">do</span> <span class="gloss-emph">talk</span> <span class="gloss">what</span>?</td>

<tr>
<td><b>Look at</b> this!</td>

<td><span class="gloss">me</span> <span class="gloss">do</span> <span class="gloss-emph">cope</span> <span class="gloss">loss</span></td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table></div>



An exception is verbs that take indirect objects with the preposition <span class="english">to,</span> like <span class="english">talk to</span>. These are explained in the section on indirect objects.

In some cases where English has different meanings for different prepositions, Trevorese has different verbs. In these cases you’ll notice that English also generally offers us easy synonyms:

<div class="table-container"><table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>en</th>
<th>gloss</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>What are you <b>looking at</b>?</td>
<td><span class="gloss">you</span> <span class="gloss">do</span> <span class="gloss-emph">see</span> <span class="gloss">what-thing</span>?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>What are you <b>looking for</b>?</td>
<td><span class="gloss">you</span> <span class="gloss">do</span> <span class="gloss-emph">seek</span> <span class="gloss">what-thing</span>?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>What are you<b>looking up</b>?</td>
<td><span class="gloss">you</span> <span class="gloss">do</span> <span class="gloss-emph">seek</span> <span class="gloss">what-thing</span>?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>What are you<b>looking after</b>?</td>
<td><span class="gloss">you</span> <span class="gloss">do</span> <span class="gloss-emph">care</span> <span class="gloss">what-thing</span>?</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table></div>


In other cases there is some ambiguity:
<div class="table-container"><table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>en</th>
<th>gloss</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>She <b>believes</b> me</td>
<td><span class="gloss">this</span> <span class="gloss">do</span> <span class="gloss-emph">truth-think</span> <span class="gloss">me</span></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>She <b>believes in</b> God</td>
<td><span class="gloss">this</span> <span class="gloss">do</span> <span class="gloss-emph">truth-think</span> <span class="gloss">God</span></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>She <b>believes in</b> me</td>
<td><span class="gloss">this</span> <span class="gloss">do</span> <span class="gloss-emph">trust</span> <span class="gloss">me</span></td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table></div>


Notice however that even in English, <span class="english">believe in</span> has a different meaning when applied to God versus to me! Really, there is ambiguity everywhere in all languages, but context clears almost everything up!

<div class="section-h3"><div class="collapsible-header">Quantifiers and the wh- words</div><div class="collapsible-content">
    This <span class="gloss">what</span> that we have been using to form questions is what is called (in Trevorese grammar) a quantifier. Quantifiers are little words that tell us something about the way that an object exists. They come before the noun. The quantifiers we have seen so far are <span class="gloss">this</span>, <span class="gloss">that</span>, <span class="gloss">what</span>, <span class="gloss">number</span>, no</span>, and numbers, like 67.

Two more words that fall in this category in English are <span class="english">some</span> and <span class="english">any</span>. For the most part these are entirely unnecessary in Trevorese:

However, if you need to stress the non-specificness of something, you can use <span class="gloss">no-specific</span>:

<div class="table-container"><table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>en</th>
<th>gloss</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>Which cat do you talk to?</td>
<td><span class="gloss">you</span> <span class="gloss">do</span> <span class="gloss">talk</span> <span class="gloss">direction</span> <span class="gloss">what</span> <span class="gloss">cat</span>?</td>

</table></div>




There is one more of these, <span class="gloss">all,</span> meaning <span class="english">every/each</span> or <span class="english">complete:</span><div class="table-container"><table>
<thead>

</table></div>



With these in our arsenal, we can now express an amazing range of things. Let’s introduce some more words:
<div class="table-container"><table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>en</th>
<th>gloss</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>place</td>
<td><span class="gloss">place</span></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>thing</td>
<td><span class="gloss">thing</span></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>time</td>
<td><span class="gloss">time</span></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>reason</td>
<td><span class="gloss">reason</span></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>way</td>
<td><span class="gloss">way</span></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>amount/number</td>
<td><span class="gloss">number</span></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>person</td>
<td><span class="gloss">person</span></td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table></div>


These words are very powerful when combined with the quantifiers ! Let’s see what happens when we combine them with the question word <span class="gloss">what:</span><div class="table-container"><table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>en</th>
<th>gloss</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>which? / what?</td>
<td><span class="gloss">what</span>?</td>

<tr>

</tbody>
</table></div>


How might you answer these questions?
<div class="table-container"><table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>en</th>

<td><span class="gloss">this</span> <span class="gloss">place</span> / <span class="gloss">that</span> <span class="gloss">place</span> / <span class="gloss">place</span> (so <span class="gloss">no-specific</span>)</td>

</tr>
</tbody>
</table></div>



Similarly, with the universal quantifier:
<div class="table-container"><table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>en</th>
<th>gloss</th>
</tr>

<tbody>
<tr>
<td>everywhere</td>
<td><span class="gloss">all</span> <span class="gloss">place</span></td>

</table></div>



Look closely at these. In English, we have so many different words for these concepts, and it hides how similar they all are! It is common for a language to be like English in this way, and have some collection of concepts from different roots and languages, such that the true structure is hidden. However, several other languages actually make these relations perfectly clear — for instance Telugu, what uses exactly the structure described above!

</div></div>
<div class="section-h3"><div class="collapsible-header">an adjective can be a whole sentence! (relative clauses)</div><div class="collapsible-content">
Let’s get back to adjectives. As you recall, adjectives are just formed by saying that a noun is <b>like</b> another noun:
<div class="table-container"><table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>en</th>
<th>gloss</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>a cat</td>
<td><span class="gloss">cat</span></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>a black cat</td>
<td><span class="gloss">cat</span> <span class="gloss">like</span> <span class="gloss">dark-color</span></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>a little baby</td>
<td><span class="gloss">new-person</span> <span class="gloss">like</span> <span class="gloss">small</span></td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table></div>



But what if you want to say that the cat is like something more complicated than a single noun? What if you want to say that the cat is like a little baby?
<div class="table-container"><table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>en</th>
<th>gloss</th>

<td>a cat <b>that is like</b> a little baby</td>

You can do that too! In fact, you can put a full sentence in front of the <span class="gloss">like,</span> as long as it describes how that cat is:
<div class="table-container"><table>

Note that according to the “proper” English grammar, this last example is impossible to express. As you can see, “like” is a very powerful tool! It is used anywhere English uses “that” to start a relative clause.

NB: The <span class="gloss">this</span> is optional here, and usually left out; it is included in parentheses for completeness

<div class="section-h3"><div class="collapsible-header">Comparative and Superlative</div><div class="collapsible-content">
When we compare things in Trevorese, we can think of them as if they are on a mountain, with the higher ones up being more of that adjective, and the one on the top being the most of that adjective!

We can do this with <span class="gloss">like</span> clauses. Here are the relevant words:
<div class="table-container"><table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>en</th>
<th>gloss</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>over</td>
<td><span class="gloss">over</span></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>under</td>
<td><span class="gloss">down</span></td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table></div>



To make a comparative statement like <span class="english">I am bigger than you</span>, we say something like &lt;I am big over you&gt;, similar to how in Nigerian Pidgin you would say “I am big past you”:
<div class="table-container"><table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>en</th>
<th>gloss</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>That cat is sweet<b>er</b> than this cat</td>
<td><span class="gloss">That</span> <span class="gloss">cat</span> <span class="gloss">like</span> <span class="gloss">sugar</span> <span class="gloss-emph">over</span> <span class="gloss">this</span> <span class="gloss">cat</span></td>

<tr>
<td>My cat is bigg<b>er</b> than your dog</td>
<td><span class="gloss">cat</span> <span class="gloss">of</span> <span class="gloss">me</span> <span class="gloss">like</span> <span class="gloss">big</span> <span class="gloss-emph">over</span> <span class="gloss">dog</span> <span class="gloss">of</span> <span class="gloss">you</span></td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table></div>



Consider the following argument between two people about which cat is sweeter:
<div class="table-container"><table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>en</th>
<th>gloss</th>

<tbody>
<tr>
<td>this cat is sweet</td>
<td><span class="gloss">this</span> <span class="gloss">cat</span> <span class="gloss">like</span> <span class="gloss">sugar</span></td>

</tr>
</tbody>
</table></div>



Hopefully, they will eventually reach a conclusion like the following:
<div class="table-container"><table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>en</th>
<th>gloss</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>That cat is <b>as sweet as</b> this cat</td>
<td><span class="gloss">that</span> <span class="gloss">cat</span> <span class="gloss">like</span> <span class="gloss-emph">sugar</span> <span class="gloss-emph">one-kind</span> <span class="gloss-emph">of</span> <span class="gloss">this</span> <span class="gloss">cat</span></td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table></div>



On the other hand, they might start using the superlative:
<div class="table-container"><table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>en</th>
<th>gloss</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>That cat is <b>the sweetest</b></td>
<td><span class="gloss">that</span> <span class="gloss">cat</span> <span class="gloss">like</span> <span class="gloss-emph">over-thing</span> <span class="gloss-emph">sugar</span></td>

</tr>
</tbody>
</table></div>


Note: you could also express this as “that cat like <b>sweetness beyond all</b>”, though this is less idiomatic.

<div class="section-h3"><div class="collapsible-header">Verbs 3: Verbs acting on other verbs: tenses and modals</div><div class="collapsible-content">
We have seen how to use a verb with a noun as its object:
normal verb: <span class="english">I see a dog</span> (the object of <span class="english">see</span> is <span class="english">dog</span> is a noun)
Now let’s talk about verbs that act on other verbs, which we can call “modal verbs”:
modal verb: <span class="english">I can sing</span> (the object of <span class="english">can</span> is <span class="english">sing,</span> a verb)

The most common verbs that act on other verbs are a set of five or so verbs that actually can ONLY{{There is a gray zone with words like “want” and “must”. In German, “want” is a modal, but in English, it is a verb. In both, “must” is modal, even though you can also need an object.
}} take verbs as objects. For instance, you <span class="english">I can sing</span> works, but <span class="english">I can the cat</span> has no meaning. These verbs are often called modal verbs in other languages, and usually function in special ways.{{For example, in English, there is no infinitive for modals. you can’t say *“He wants to <b>can</b> go” or *“Will she <b>may</b> visit me?” you have to say “He wants to <b>be able to</b> go” and “Will she <b>be allowed to</b> visit me?” Similarly, in Chinese, you can say “我能唱歌”, but you can’t say *“我<b>想</b>能唱歌”. In German, modals are more like normal verbs, but only modals can have special constructions like “Sie hat das nicht sagen <b>dürfen</b>”. All in all, in many languages, modals function much more like adverbs than verbs, and some analyses don’t treat them as verbs at all.
}} Here is their use in Trevorese:
<div class="table-container"><table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>en</th>
<th>gloss</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>the cat <b>can (is able to)</b> talk</td>
<td><span class="gloss">cat</span> <span class="gloss-emph">can</span> <span class="gloss-emph">do</span> <span class="gloss">talk</span></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>the cat <b>may (is allowed to)</b> talk</td>
<td><span class="gloss">cat</span> <span class="gloss-emph">can</span> <span class="gloss-emph">do</span> <span class="gloss">talk</span></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>the cat <b>should (ought to)</b> talk</td>
<td><span class="gloss">cat</span> <span class="gloss-emph">must</span> <span class="gloss-emph">do</span> <span class="gloss">talk</span></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>the cat <b>might (possibly will)</b> talk</td>
<td><span class="gloss">cat</span> <span class="gloss-emph">may</span> <span class="gloss-emph">do</span> <span class="gloss">talk</span></td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table></div>


Then there are a lot of other verbs that can act on verbs OR nouns. In English/German/etc., these are treated differently; in Trevorese they are the same as the so-called “true modals”:
<div class="table-container"><table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>en</th>
<th>gloss</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>the cat <b>must (has to/needs to)</b> talk</td>
<td><span class="gloss">cat</span> <span class="gloss-emph">big-want</span> <span class="gloss-emph">do</span> <span class="gloss">talk</span></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>the cat <b>wants to</b> talk</td>
<td><span class="gloss">cat</span> <span class="gloss">want</span> <span class="gloss">do</span> <span class="gloss">talk</span></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>the cat <b>tries to</b> talk</td>
<td><span class="gloss">cat</span> <span class="gloss">seek</span> <span class="gloss">do</span> <span class="gloss">talk</span></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>the cat <b>likes to</b> talk</td>
<td><span class="gloss">cat</span> <span class="gloss">good-energy</span> <span class="gloss">do</span> <span class="gloss">talk</span></td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table></div>



Important note: You may notice that there is only one do at the end here, and not before the first verb! This is optional (but preferred). You can also explicitly add all the do s:

<div class="table-container"><table border="1">
<thead>
<tr><th>en</th><th>gloss</th></tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr><td>the cat <b>can</b> talk</td><td><span class="gloss">cat</span> <span class="gloss-emph">can</span> <span class="gloss-emph">do</span> <span class="gloss">talk</span> [normal <span class="gloss">form</span>]<br/><span class="gloss">cat</span> <span class="gloss-emph">do</span> <span class="gloss-emph">can</span> <span class="gloss-emph">do</span> <span class="gloss">talk</span> [explicit <span class="gloss">form</span>]</td></tr>
<tr><td>the cat <b>wants to</b> talk</td><td><span class="gloss">cat</span> <span class="gloss">want</span> <span class="gloss">do</span> <span class="gloss">talk</span> [normal <span class="gloss">form</span>]<br/><span class="gloss">cat</span> <span class="gloss">do</span> <span class="gloss-emph">want</span> <span class="gloss-emph">do</span> <span class="gloss">talk</span> [explicit <span class="gloss">form</span>]</td></tr>
</tbody>
</table></div>




Verbs that act on other verbs are incredibly powerful, and capture all the different ways you can perform a noun – including tense!  When we told you about tenses before, we only told you half the story. What we didn’t tell you is that the two tense markers we taught you — <span class="gloss">back</span> and <span class="gloss">front</span> — are in fact themselves just a special case of verbs acting on verbs. Observe:

<div class="table-container"><table border="1">
<thead>
<tr><th>en</th><th>gloss</th></tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr><td>the cat <b>is</b> talk<b>ing</b><br/>the cat <b>talks</b></td><td><span class="gloss">cat</span> <span class="gloss-emph">do</span> <span class="gloss">talk</span></td></tr>
<tr><td>the cat <b>did</b> talk<br/>the cat talk<b>ed</b></td><td><span class="gloss">cat</span> <span class="gloss">back</span> <span class="gloss-emph">do</span> <span class="gloss">talk</span></td></tr>
<tr><td>the cat <b>will</b> talk<br/>the cat <b>is going to</b> talk</td><td><span class="gloss">cat</span> <span class="gloss-emph">front</span> <span class="gloss-emph">do</span> <span class="gloss">talk</span></td></tr>
</tbody>
</table></div>


All these constructions are all formed the same way! And indeed, in Trevorese, there is no difference between “tenses” and “modal verbs”. The concept of a “tense” as it is usually conceived is based on how Indo-European languages work, where tenses are treated in a special way, but modals are treated more like verbs. However, in other languages, it’s not so. In Chinese, Vietnamese, or Malay, tenses are expressed as adverbs, and in Telugu, tenses and modals are in the same category of suffixes!

Does this last sentence look a bit extreme? It’s really not! consider this dialogue:
A: “Hey, you said your organization was going to create a robot, right? How’d that go? Were you going to let it talk to other employees?”
B: “It went terribly. It should not have been allowed to be able to try to talk to others. We shouldn’t have let it even have the capability to initiate conversation.”


<h4>multiple verbs acting on verbs with adverbs in between</h4>

<h4>Note on “want” and other verbs that can act on nouns OR verbs</h4>
“Want” is a special word that deserves its own section. You can 1) want something (“want” is a verb), 2) want to do something (“want” is a modal verb); 3) want to be something; or 4) want that something happens.{{  “Want” is often treated oddly. In English it functions as a verb; in German it functions as a modal. In Chinese, you can use 想 only to want a verb, but not a noun. In Arabic, Irish, and Hebrew, there is no verb for wanting; you just say the object of verb is “from you”. And even the English word “want” originally just means to lack.
}} These are straightforward but worth mentioning:
<div class="table-container"><table border="1">
<thead>
<tr><th>en</th><th>gloss</th></tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr><td>the cat wants a mouse</td><td><span class="gloss">cat</span> <span class="gloss">do</span> <span class="gloss">want</span> <span class="gloss">bite-animal</span><br/><span class="gloss">deleteme</span></td></tr>
<tr><td>the cat wants to sing</td><td><span class="gloss">cat</span> <span class="gloss">want</span> <span class="gloss">do</span> <span class="gloss">sing</span> [normal <span class="gloss">form</span>]<br/><span class="gloss">cat</span> <span class="gloss">do</span> <span class="gloss">want</span> <span class="gloss">do</span> <span class="gloss">sing</span> [explicit <span class="gloss">form</span>]</td></tr>
<tr><td>the cat wants to be a mouse</td><td><span class="gloss">cat</span> <span class="gloss">want</span> <span class="gloss">do</span> <span class="gloss">be</span> <span class="gloss">bite-animal</span><br/><span class="gloss">deleteme</span></td></tr>
<tr><td>the cat wants to be able to talk</td><td><span class="gloss">cat</span> <span class="gloss">want</span> <span class="gloss">can</span> <span class="gloss">do</span> <span class="gloss">talk</span><br/><span class="gloss">deleteme</span></td></tr>
<tr><td>the cat wants the mouse to be here</td><td><span class="gloss">cat</span> <span class="gloss">want</span> <span class="gloss">bite-animal</span> <span class="gloss">do</span> <span class="gloss">be</span> <span class="gloss">here</span><br/><span class="gloss">deleteme</span></td></tr>
</tbody>
</table></div>




This is the same story for any verb that can take a noun or a verb as its object, like “try”, “like”, “need”, etc.

You may have been confused about this “explicit form” business for when verbs act on other verbs. Now you can see the reasoning more clearly:
normal form (only put “do” before last verb)
clearly signals that you’re wanting an action instead of an object
easier to say (don’t repeat “do”)
explicit form (“do” before every verb)
“the cat wants to sing” and “the cat wants a mouse” are more parallel because they both start with “cat do want”

Overall, you can ignore this though! use whichever one you want.

Many languages have a special way of marking things when they are being used to do something. Trevorese, like Chinese, simply uses “use”. It is just another case of a verb acting on another verb.

Note that the English “with” here is an instrumental marker in English, and actually a quite different meaning from the normal meaning. For the normal meaning of “with”, this would mean “He and a shovel were digging a hole”!

<div class="section-h3"><div class="collapsible-header">Indirect objects</div><div class="collapsible-content">
Some verbs have two objects. Consider the verbs “give” , “say”, “talk”, and “throw”. They can have a single object:

<div class="table-container"><table>

<tbody>
<tr>
<td>He gives a gift.</td>
<td><span class="gloss">this</span> <span class="gloss">do</span> <span class="gloss">give</span> <span class="gloss">gift</span></td>

However, you can also add a second object with a preposition like <b>to</b> or <b>at.</b> This second object is called the indirect object. Just as English, Trevorese marks these with the preposition “to” (aka <span class="gloss">direction)</span><div class="table-container"><table>

To an English speaker, this should be pretty straightforward: you just indicate the recipient of the verb phrase with <span class="gloss">direction.</span> Why is it worth mentioning? First of all, other languages treat indirect objects differently (e.g. with the Dative case). Second of all, English has another way of  marking the indirect object, just by using the word order:
<div class="table-container"><table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>en</th>
<th>gloss</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>He gives <b>me</b> a gift</td>
<td><span class="gloss">this</span> <span class="gloss">do</span> <span class="gloss">give</span> <span class="gloss">gift</span> <span class="gloss-emph">direction</span> <span class="gloss-emph">me</span></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>He talks <b>to me</b> about work</td>
<td><span class="gloss">this</span> <span class="gloss">do</span> <span class="gloss">talk</span> <span class="gloss">hard-do</span> <span class="gloss-emph">direction</span> <span class="gloss-emph">me</span></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>He throws <b>me</b> a rock</td>
<td><span class="gloss">this</span> <span class="gloss">do</span> <span class="gloss">throw</span> <span class="gloss">rock</span> <span class="gloss-emph">direction</span> <span class="gloss-emph">me</span></td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table></div>


In Trevorese, you can never omit the preposition <span class="gloss">direction</span>  for the indirect object.

There are a few verbs in English that use “to” even when it appears to be a direct object. For instance, you talk to someone. However, in these cases this is because there is an implied indirect object: when you talk to someone, you are actually saying words (the direct object) to someone (the indirect object). The situation is the same for Trevorese: for these verbs with implied objects, we use the preposition <span class="gloss">direction:</span><div class="table-container"><table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>en</th>
<th>gloss</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>He <b>talks about</b> people</td>
<td><span class="gloss">this</span> <span class="gloss">do</span> <span class="gloss-emph">talk</span> <span class="gloss">number</span> <span class="gloss">people</span></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>He <b>talks to</b> people</td>
<td><span class="gloss">this</span> <span class="gloss">do</span> <span class="gloss-emph">talk</span> <span class="gloss-emph">direction</span> <span class="gloss">number</span> <span class="gloss">people</span></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>He <b>writes a</b> letter</td>
<td><span class="gloss">this</span> <span class="gloss">do</span> <span class="gloss-emph">write</span> <span class="gloss">letter</span></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>He <b>writes about</b> pigs</td>
<td><span class="gloss">this</span> <span class="gloss">do</span> <span class="gloss-emph">write</span> <span class="gloss">number</span> <span class="gloss">pig</span></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>He <b>writes to</b> me</td>
<td><span class="gloss">this</span> <span class="gloss">do</span> <span class="gloss-emph">write</span> <span class="gloss-emph">direction</span> <span class="gloss">me</span></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><b>Give</b> [<b>to]</b> me the girl!</td>
<td><span class="gloss">you</span> <span class="gloss">do</span> <span class="gloss-emph">give</span> <span class="gloss">girl</span> <span class="gloss-emph">direction</span> <span class="gloss">me</span>!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><b>Give me to</b>the girl!</td>
<td><span class="gloss">you</span> <span class="gloss">do</span> <span class="gloss-emph">give</span> <span class="gloss">me</span> <span class="gloss-emph">direction</span> <span class="gloss">girl</span>!</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table></div>


This point should not pose problems for speakers of English: they should just translate “to” into <span class="gloss">direction.</span> This should be familiar also to speakers of Chinese, where direction can be interpreted as 对: one can see that above, the treatment of <span class="english">to talk</span> is the same as Chinese 说 vs 说对.

Note 1: In Chinese, there is the exact same phenomenon, where if there is no particle, the first object is the indirect object and the second is direct (I give you a thing / 我给你一个东西). if you invert the order of the objects but want the same meaning, you need to add a particle (I give a thing <b>to</b> you / 我<b>把</b>一个东西给你). However, instead of marking the indirect object, Chinese marks the direct object.

When speaking, we need some way to differentiate between these two objects.  For example, “give me to the girl” and  “give me the girl”  are very different sentences.

Note 2: Interestingly, in English there are also verbs where you are not allowed to use the word order, and you have to use a preposition. Consider the word <span class="english">say.</span> While you can say <span class="english">Give me the cat</span>, you can’t say <span class="wrong">*Say me the thing</span>.

<div class="section-h3"><div class="collapsible-header">Verbs 4: Infinitives and gerunds</div><div class="collapsible-content">
In Indo-European languages like English, verbs have a special form called the infinitive, which is used in certain situations when there isn’t a subject doing the verb. In English, you can often use the gerund (-ing form) in similar ways.

Many situations where IE languages use the infinitive is when you have a verb acting on another verb. We already saw how to do this:
<div class="table-container"><table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>en</th>
<th>gloss</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>the cat wants the mouse <b>to be</b> here</td>
<td><span class="gloss">cat</span> [do] <span class="gloss">want</span> <span class="gloss">bite-animal</span> <span class="gloss-emph">do</span> <span class="gloss-emph">be</span> <span class="gloss">here</span></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>She doesn’t like <b>walking</b> / She doesn’t like <b>to walk</b></td>
<td><span class="gloss">this</span> <span class="gloss">no</span> [do] <span class="gloss">like</span> <span class="gloss-emph">do</span> <span class="gloss-emph">go-arm-go</span></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>He thinks of <b>talking</b></td>
<td><span class="gloss">this</span> [do] <span class="gloss">think</span> <span class="gloss-emph">do</span> <span class="gloss-emph">talk</span></td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table></div>



Another situation where IE languages use an infinitive or gerund is when you are referring to the general state of a verb, as in “walking is good” or “It is good to walk.”. In this case, the verb has become a sort of noun, meaning “the state of walking”. In Trevorese, we just need to add the “do” to show that it is a verb, and then you can use it like any other noun:
<div class="table-container"><table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>en</th>
<th>gloss</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td><b>Walking</b> is good / It is good <b>to walk</b>.</td>
<td><span class="gloss-emph">do</span> <span class="gloss-emph">go-arm-go</span> <span class="gloss">do</span> <span class="gloss">be</span> <span class="gloss">good</span>.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>He thinks <b>talking</b> is hard / it is hard <b>to talk</b></td>
<td><span class="gloss">this</span> <span class="gloss">do</span> <span class="gloss">think</span> <span class="gloss-emph">do</span> <span class="gloss-emph">talk</span> <span class="gloss">do</span> <span class="gloss">be</span> <span class="gloss">no-easy</span></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><b>Being</b> a student is fun / It is fun <b>to be</b> a student.</td>
<td><span class="gloss-emph">do</span> <span class="gloss-emph">be</span> <span class="gloss">get-know-person</span> <span class="gloss">do</span> <span class="gloss">be</span> <span class="gloss">good-time</span></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>You <b>being</b> here makes me happy.</td>
<td><span class="gloss">you</span> <span class="gloss-emph">do</span> <span class="gloss-emph">be</span> <span class="gloss">this</span> <span class="gloss">place</span> <span class="gloss">do</span> <span class="gloss">make</span> <span class="gloss">me</span> <span class="gloss">good-energy</span>.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><b>The fact that you are</b> here makes me happy.</td>
<td><span class="gloss">you</span> <span class="gloss-emph">do</span> <span class="gloss-emph">be</span> <span class="gloss">this</span> <span class="gloss">place</span> <span class="gloss">do</span> <span class="gloss">make</span> <span class="gloss">me</span> <span class="gloss">good-energy</span>.</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table></div>


Serendipitously, this ends up sounding similar to the English construction “to Verb”!

Finally, there are situations in English where gerunds like <span class="english">being</span> pop up just because English uses “to be” for adjectives as well:
<div class="table-container"><table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>en</th>
<th>gloss</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>He was being cute</td>
<td><span class="gloss">this</span> <span class="gloss">back</span> <span class="gloss">like</span> <span class="gloss">cute</span></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>She is being mean to me</td>
<td><span class="gloss">this</span> <span class="gloss">like</span> <span class="gloss">mean</span> <span class="gloss-emph">direction</span> <span class="gloss">me</span></td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table></div>
</div></div>
<div class="section-h3"><div class="collapsible-header">Verbs 5: Clauses and conjunctions</div><div class="collapsible-content">

The most basic way to make two clauses in Trevorese is to just put two sentences one after the other:
<div class="table-container"><table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>en</th>
<th>gloss</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>I told you</td>
<td><span class="gloss">me</span> <span class="gloss">back</span> <span class="gloss">do</span> <span class="gloss">say</span> <span class="gloss">you</span></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>the cat talked</td>
<td><span class="gloss">cat</span> <span class="gloss">back</span> <span class="gloss">do</span> <span class="gloss">talk</span></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>I told you (that) the cat talked</td>
<td><span class="gloss">me</span> <span class="gloss">back</span> <span class="gloss">do</span> <span class="gloss">say</span>, <span class="gloss">you</span> <span class="gloss">cat</span> <span class="gloss">back</span> <span class="gloss">do</span> <span class="gloss">talk</span></td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table></div>


In English, we can optionally put a “that” in there to make the causality clear. In Trevorese, as in Chinese, there is no such word and you just put the clauses next to each other. Of course, you can also use conjunctions to connect two clauses:

<div class="table-container"><table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>en</th>
<th>gloss</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>I told you, <b>but</b> the cat talked</td>
<td><span class="gloss">me</span> <span class="gloss">back</span> <span class="gloss">do</span> <span class="gloss">say</span> <span class="gloss">you</span>, <span class="gloss-emph">against</span> <span class="gloss">cat</span> <span class="gloss">back</span> <span class="gloss">do</span> <span class="gloss">talk</span></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>I told you, <b>and</b> the cat talked</td>
<td><span class="gloss">me</span> <span class="gloss">back</span> <span class="gloss">do</span> <span class="gloss">say</span> <span class="gloss">you</span>, <span class="gloss-emph">also</span> <span class="gloss">cat</span> <span class="gloss">back</span> <span class="gloss">do</span> <span class="gloss">talk</span></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>I told you, <b>so</b> the cat talked</td>
<td><span class="gloss">me</span> <span class="gloss">back</span> <span class="gloss">do</span> <span class="gloss">say</span> <span class="gloss">you</span>, <span class="gloss-emph">then</span> <span class="gloss-emph">this-reason</span> <span class="gloss">cat</span> <span class="gloss">back</span> <span class="gloss">do</span> <span class="gloss">talk</span></td>

</tr>
</tbody>
</table></div>
</div></div>
<div class="section-h3"><div class="collapsible-header">other</div><div class="collapsible-content">
“other” is the last of the quantifiers we haven’t introduced:
<div class="table-container"><table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>en</th>
<th>gloss</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>I saw a <b>another</b> cat</td>
<td><span class="gloss">me</span> <span class="gloss">back</span> <span class="gloss">do</span> <span class="gloss">see</span> <span class="gloss-emph">other</span> <span class="gloss">cat</span></td>

</tr>
</tbody>
</table></div>
</div></div>
<div class="section-h3"><div class="collapsible-header">Self, own, each other</div><div class="collapsible-content">

If the subject of a verb is the same as an object, you can use “self”. It doesn’t get tangled weirdly into verbs like Spanish “se” or German “sich”. Using “self” doesn’t change the meaning of the verb at all.
<div class="table-container"><table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>en</th>
<th>gloss</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>he washed the towel</td>
<td><span class="gloss">this</span> <span class="gloss">back</span> <span class="gloss">do</span> <span class="gloss">no-dirt</span> <span class="gloss">water-flat-stuff</span></td>

</tr>
</tbody>
</table></div>



The English word “own”, in the sense of “their own”, really means “of their self”. It is expressed this way in Trevorese (as it is in Chinese):
<div class="table-container"><table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>en</th>
<th>gloss</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>he ate <b>his own</b> feces</td>
<td><span class="gloss">this</span> <span class="gloss">back</span> <span class="gloss">do</span> <span class="gloss">eat</span> <span class="gloss">feces</span> <span class="gloss-emph">of</span> <span class="gloss-emph">self</span></td>

</tr>
</tbody>
</table></div>



To express “each other”, use “other self”:
<div class="table-container"><table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>en</th>
<th>gloss</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>they flog <b>themselves</b></td>
<td><span class="gloss">number</span> <span class="gloss">this</span> <span class="gloss">do</span> <span class="gloss">flog</span> <span class="gloss-emph">self</span></td>

<tr>
<td>they flog <b>each other</b></td>
<td><span class="gloss">number</span> <span class="gloss">this</span> <span class="gloss">do</span> <span class="gloss">flog</span> <span class="gloss-emph">other</span> <span class="gloss-emph">self</span></td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table></div><h4>Emphasis</h4>
English has a messy system of stressing a word with tone. Trevorese adopts the more common approach of adding a particle after a word to stress it, and this word is “self”, much like how in English, we might say “he himself said so”, or “he himself admitted himself that he suck”.
<div class="table-container"><table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>en</th>
<th>gloss</th>

<tr>

This also ends up sounding like the emphatic clitics in Irish.

Also is a funny little word that basically just adds some emphasis. It’s a regular adjective/adverb in Trevorese, like in English:

<div class="table-container"><table border="1">

<tbody>
<tr><td>I <b>also</b> saw a cat<br/>I <b>too</b> saw a cat<br/>I saw a cat <b>as well</b></td><td><span class="gloss">me</span> <span class="gloss">back</span> <span class="gloss">do</span> <span class="gloss">see</span> <span class="gloss">cat</span> <span class="gloss-emph">like</span> <span class="gloss-emph">also</span></td></tr>

TODO finish this and maybe put it in the lexicon section

Many Trevorese terms are more ambiguous than English terms. For instance, <span class="gloss">person</span> means any being, either human or animal; and <span class="gloss">ball</span> means either a sphere or a circle. In 90% of the cases, these are unambiguous in context. However, what do you do if you really need to specify that something is a circle, not a sphere? In this case you can use the more explicit form, known as the disambiguation form. For instance:

<div class="table-container"><table>

You may have noticed this already, but in Trevorese, most words are nouns. A verb is just “doing” a noun, and an adjective is just being “like” a noun. Therefore, there are only the following parts of speech:

<ol>
<li>nouns (and pronouns)
    <ol type="a">
<li>verbs: “do noun”</li>
<li> modals: like verbs</li>
<li> conjunctions: noun placed before clause</li>

<div class="section-h3"><div class="collapsible-header">Other tenses with special Adverbs</div><div class="collapsible-content">
The second important subtlety to using verbs well is adverbs. Let’s introduce a few very important adverbs:

<div class="table-container"><table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>en</th>
<th>gloss</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>usually</td>
<td><span class="gloss">custom</span></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>ever</td>

</tr>
<tr>
<td>already</td>
<td><span class="gloss">before</span></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>just</td>
<td><span class="gloss">just</span></td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table></div>



These allow us to express other tenses in various languages. Let’s look at them one-by-one:

<span class="gloss">custom</span> is used for any habitual action: just use it as an adverb modifying the verb, e.g. &lt;you normally go&gt; “<span class="gloss">you do go like custom</span>”. In English, this is expressed with “used to” in the past tense, by the simple present tense or “usually” in the present, and by the progressive “-ing” in in the future:
<div class="table-container"><table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>en</th>
<th>gloss</th>

<tbody>
<tr>
<td>I am walking to school</td>
<td><span class="gloss">I</span> <span class="gloss">do</span> <span class="gloss">go-arm-go</span> <span class="gloss">direction</span> <span class="gloss">learn-place</span></td>

</tr>
</tbody>
</table></div><span class="gloss">just</span> is used exactly as the English “just”, to express a time very close to the present. However, English needs a lot of extra words to express this when combined with different tenses:

English has a tense called the perfect (“have”),{{ Most Indo-European languages have this, but it has different meanings in them, leading to confusion for learners. In Spanish, “he comido” carries the connotation that it just happened, and in German it is the default past tense, so “Ich bin gelaufen” just means “I ran”.
}} as in the sentence “I have been to Germany” or “More people have been to Berlin than me”. All this is really conveying is that the action has, indeed, happened at least once, and likely many times, in contrast to a statement like “I went to Germany”, which just means you went a particular time. So in effect, the perfect is just saying that you went some time(s).

At this point we introduce the Trevorese word <span class="gloss">times:</span><div class="table-container"><table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>en</th>
<th>gloss</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>I fell</td>
<td><span class="gloss">I</span> <span class="gloss">back</span> <span class="gloss">do</span> <span class="gloss">down</span></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>I fell once</td>
<td><span class="gloss">I</span> <span class="gloss">back</span> <span class="gloss">do</span> <span class="gloss">down</span> <span class="gloss">like</span> <span class="gloss">one</span> <span class="gloss">times</span></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>I fell twice</td>
<td><span class="gloss">I</span> <span class="gloss">back</span> <span class="gloss">do</span> <span class="gloss">down</span> <span class="gloss">like</span> <span class="gloss">two</span> <span class="gloss">times</span></td>

<tr>
<td>I fell 67 times</td>

</tr>
</tbody>
</table></div>



If you use times without any quantifier, it just means “one or more times”:
<div class="table-container"><table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>en</th>
<th>gloss</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>I fell some number of times</td>
<td><span class="gloss">I</span> <span class="gloss">back</span> <span class="gloss">do</span> <span class="gloss">down</span> <span class="gloss">like</span> <span class="gloss">times</span></td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table></div>


However, English has a different way of expressing this: the perfect tense! Hence:
<div class="table-container"><table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>en</th>
<th>gloss</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>I have fallen</td>
<td><span class="gloss">I</span> <span class="gloss">back</span> <span class="gloss">do</span> <span class="gloss">down</span> <span class="gloss-emph">like</span> <span class="gloss-emph">times</span></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>I have walked to school</td>
<td><span class="gloss">I</span> <span class="gloss">back</span> <span class="gloss">do</span> <span class="gloss">go-arm-go</span> <span class="gloss-emph">like</span> <span class="gloss-emph">times</span> <span class="gloss">direction</span> <span class="gloss">learn-place</span></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>I have walked to school twice</td>
<td><span class="gloss">I</span> <span class="gloss">back</span> <span class="gloss">do</span> <span class="gloss">go-arm-go</span> <span class="gloss-emph">like</span> <span class="gloss-emph">two</span> <span class="gloss-emph">times</span> <span class="gloss">direction</span> <span class="gloss">learn-place</span></td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table></div>



English also has the curiously named tense, the pluperfect (the “had verbed” tense). This is specifically used for things that happened in the past and were already completed before another thing happened in the past — it’s kind of like “the past with respect to the past”. However, there is also a much simpler way of expressing the same thing in English: “already”. Trevorese takes this approach, with <span class="gloss">already:</span><div class="table-container"><table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>en</th>
<th>gloss</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>I had walked to school, but he didn’t know</td>
<td><span class="gloss">I</span> <span class="gloss">back</span> <span class="gloss">do</span> <span class="gloss">go-arm-go</span> <span class="gloss-emph">like</span> <span class="gloss-emph">before</span> <span class="gloss">to</span> <span class="gloss">learn-place</span>, <span class="gloss">against</span> <span class="gloss">this</span> <span class="gloss">not</span> [past] <span class="gloss">do</span> <span class="gloss">know</span></td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table></div>
</div></div>
<div class="section-h3"><div class="collapsible-header">Future Perfect Tense</div><div class="collapsible-content">
The future perfect tense, or “past within future”, is a feature of Indo-European languages that occurs in dependent clauses. In Trevorese, it is simply expressed with the past:
<div class="table-container"><table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>en</th>
<th>gloss</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>Next year we <b>will have bought</b> two dogs</td>
<td>&lt;Next <span class="gloss">year</span> <span class="gloss">we</span> <span class="gloss">did</span> <span class="gloss">buy</span> <span class="gloss">two</span> <span class="gloss">dogs</span>&gt; <span class="gloss">year</span> <span class="gloss">like</span> <span class="gloss">next</span> <span class="gloss">number</span> <span class="gloss">me</span> <span class="gloss-emph">back</span> <span class="gloss-emph">do</span> <span class="gloss-emph">buy</span> <span class="gloss">two</span> <span class="gloss">dog</span></td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table></div>



The context makes it clear that this “we did buy two dogs” is happening relative to the future, i.e. “next year”. Conversely, one can just as easily form the “future within past” tense!
<div class="table-container"><table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>en</th>
<th>gloss</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>Last year we <b>were going to buy</b> two dogs</td>
<td>&lt;Last <span class="gloss">year</span> <span class="gloss">we</span> <span class="gloss">will</span> <span class="gloss">buy</span> <span class="gloss">two</span> <span class="gloss">dogs</span>&gt; <span class="gloss">year</span> <span class="gloss">like</span> <span class="gloss">last</span> <span class="gloss">number</span> <span class="gloss">me</span> <span class="gloss-emph">will</span> <span class="gloss-emph">buy</span> <span class="gloss">two</span> <span class="gloss">dog</span></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>He said that he <b>would sing</b></td>
<td>&lt;He <span class="gloss">said</span> <span class="gloss">this</span> <span class="gloss">will</span> <span class="gloss">singglt</span>; <span class="gloss">this</span> <span class="gloss">back</span> <span class="gloss">do</span> <span class="gloss">say</span> <span class="gloss">this</span> <span class="gloss-emph">will</span> <span class="gloss-emph">sing</span></td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table></div>



The future-within-past in English has to be expressed with this rather cumbersome “were going to” construction, or the verb “would” which is ambiguous because “would” also has the separate meaning of the conditional mode.

Als please consider this sentence:

Next year we were going to buy two dogs, but we decided not to


</div></div>
<div class="section-h3"><div class="collapsible-header">Past participles</div><div class="collapsible-content">
The past participle in English expresses that a verb happened to some noun. It is a special way of making a verb into an adjective. In many cases, this is TODO TODO
<ul><li>me like stress</li><li>situation like stress</li><li>apple like fall</li><li>apple like eat like half</li></ul>
In Trevorese, this is treated no differently than any other adjective phrase: it is accomplished by a like phrase with the past tense:
<div class="table-container"><table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>en</th>
<th>gloss</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>A <b>fallen</b> apple</td>
<td><span class="gloss">apple</span> <span class="gloss">like</span> <span class="gloss-emph">this</span> <span class="gloss-emph">back</span> <span class="gloss-emph">do</span> <span class="gloss-emph">down</span></td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table></div>



In English, past participles can also mean that “something did this”. In Trevorese, the construction is the same as before, but with a “<span class="gloss">some”:</span><div class="table-container"><table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>en</th>
<th>gloss</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>A <b>half-eaten</b> apple</td>
<td><span class="gloss">apple</span> <span class="gloss">like</span> [some] <span class="gloss">back</span> <span class="gloss">do</span> <span class="gloss">eat</span> <span class="gloss">half</span> [of <span class="gloss">this</span>]</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table></div>



The words in brackets are optional; as in most languages, they can be left out.

In English, past participles are a special construction only for the past participle of a verb. But in Trevorese, there is no difference between the past tense and other modals, so this same construction can be used for all the modals:
<div class="table-container"><table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>en</th>
<th>gloss</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>An apple that is about to fall</td>
<td><span class="gloss">apple</span> <span class="gloss">like</span> [this] <span class="gloss">will</span> <span class="gloss">down</span></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>An apple that is about to be eaten</td>
<td><span class="gloss">apple</span> <span class="gloss">like</span> [some] <span class="gloss">will</span> <span class="gloss">eat</span> [this]</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>An apple that can fall</td>
<td><span class="gloss">apple</span> <span class="gloss">like</span> [this] <span class="gloss">can</span> <span class="gloss">down</span></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>An edible apple</td>
<td><span class="gloss">apple</span> <span class="gloss">like</span> [some] <span class="gloss">can</span> <span class="gloss">eat</span> [this]</td>

<tr>

</table></div>



Observe that English has all sorts of different constructions for these!

<div class="section-h3"><div class="collapsible-header">Counterfactuals</div><div class="collapsible-content"><h4>The Conditional and “if”</h4>
The conditional is a special tense (or “mood” if you’re a purist) that crops up in some languages.  It’s basically identical to talking about things that would happen. In English, it’s most noticeable when it changes “will” into “would”, meaning “will go, conditional on that first statement”.

This is simple enough in Trevorese: we just use case, which is identical to “if”. Essentially, it means “In the case that…”
<div class="table-container"><table>

<tr>

</tr>
</tbody>
</table></div>


Note: the “sing” in  “if you sing, I will hear you”, even though it looks like the present tense, is actually in the future. Trevorese treats it as such.

<h4>The Subjunctive</h4>
The subjunctive happens when there is something that is happening counterfactually. For instance, in none of the sentences “If you were to come”, “If you had come”, and “I hope you come” did you actually come. Many languages, for instance Indo-European languages, have all sorts of complex ways of dealing with this situation. Trevorese, like Chinese, Telugu, Toki Pona, and so on, sidesteps this and leaves them ambiguous:


<div class="table-container"><table border="1">
<thead>
<tr><th>en</th><th>gloss</th></tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr><td>[future] if he sings, I will hear him<br/>[future subj.] if he were to sing, I would hear him<br/>deleteme<br/>deleteme</td><td> <span class="gloss-emph">case</span> <span class="gloss">this</span> <span class="gloss-emph">front</span> <span class="gloss-emph">do</span> <span class="gloss">sing</span>, <span class="gloss">me</span> <span class="gloss-emph">front</span> <span class="gloss-emph">do</span> <span class="gloss">sound-see</span> <span class="gloss">this</span></td></tr>
<tr><td>[present] if he is singing, I hear him<br/>[present subj.] if he were singing, I would hear him<br/>deleteme<br/>deleteme</td><td> <span class="gloss-emph">case</span> <span class="gloss">this</span> <span class="gloss-emph">do</span> <span class="gloss">sing</span>, <span class="gloss">me</span> <span class="gloss-emph">do</span> <span class="gloss">sound-see</span> <span class="gloss">this</span></td></tr>
<tr><td>[past] if he was singing, I heard him<br/>[past subj.] if he had been singing, I would have heard him<br/>[past subj.] if he had sung, I would have heard him<br/>[past subj.] if he would of sung, I would have heard him</td><td><span class="gloss-emph">case</span> <span class="gloss">this</span> <span class="gloss-emph">back</span> <span class="gloss-emph">do</span> <span class="gloss">sing</span>, <span class="gloss">me</span> <span class="gloss-emph">back</span> <span class="gloss-emph">do</span> <span class="gloss">sound-see</span> <span class="gloss">this</span></td></tr>
</tbody>
</table></div>






Note that the second part of the clause would be, in English, in the conditional. Conditional and subjunctive go together like bread and butter! But as we already established, there is no conditional in Trevorese, so the second half of the clause is just in normal indicative.

Now, in some cases, the fact that the subjunctive and the indicative are the same may be annoying. The default interpretation is that we are talking about a subjunctive event. If we really need to clarify, we can add “in fact” to be clear that the statement is in the indicative:
<div class="table-container"><table border="1">
<thead>
<tr><th>en</th><th>gloss</th></tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr><td>[past] if he was singing, I heard him<br/>[past subj.] if he had been singing, I would have heard him</td><td><span class="gloss">case</span> <span class="gloss">this</span> <span class="gloss">back</span> <span class="gloss">do</span> <span class="gloss">sing</span>, <span class="gloss">me</span> <span class="gloss">back</span> <span class="gloss">do</span> <span class="gloss">sound-see</span> <span class="gloss">this</span></td></tr>

</tbody>
</table></div>
</div></div>
<div class="section-h3"><div class="collapsible-header">“It”: Passive voice</div><div class="collapsible-content">
German uses even more “it: than English, e.g. “It gonged”, “It is whispered in the ear”. Irish has its own conjugation, e.g. “déartear” – it is said.

The passive is a somewhat unusual construction that crops up in some form or other in many languages. It can either be used to omit a subject, or to take responsibility away from them. Let’s look at the first example first.

Any language needs some way to have sentences that don’t have a clear subject. Consider the following sentence:

the milk was spilled

All this is saying is that someone or something spilled the milk, but the speaker is not saying who. Fortunately, Trevorese has a pronoun for someone or something: <span class="gloss">some.</span> Therefore, the passive can be expressed much more simply than in English:

<div class="table-container"><table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>en</th>
<th>gloss</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>the milk was spilled</td>
<td><span class="gloss">some</span> <span class="gloss">back</span> <span class="gloss">do</span> <span class="gloss">spill</span> <span class="gloss">milk</span></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>someone or something spilled the milk</td>
<td><span class="gloss">some</span> <span class="gloss">back</span> <span class="gloss">do</span> <span class="gloss">spill</span> <span class="gloss">milk</span></td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table></div>



Note English expresses this in the exact same way, if you care to express whether the doer was animate or inanimate, i.e. whether it was a person or thing. (TODO link that other chapter.) The same can be done in Trevorese:
<div class="table-container"><table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>en</th>
<th>gloss</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>someone spilled the milk</td>
<td><span class="gloss">some</span> <span class="gloss">person</span> <span class="gloss">back</span> <span class="gloss">do</span> <span class="gloss">spill</span> <span class="gloss">milk</span></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>something spilled the milk</td>
<td><span class="gloss">some</span> <span class="gloss">thing</span> <span class="gloss">back</span> <span class="gloss">do</span> <span class="gloss">spill</span> <span class="gloss">milk</span></td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table></div>



Now, what about the version of the passive that has a subject attached to it?

<ul><li>the milk was spilled by Fred</li></ul>
The only difference between this and the active voice is that it takes some responsibility away from Fred. This distinction doesn’t add much to the expressivity of the language, and can safely be removed. As such, Trevorese just uses the active voice in these constructions:

<div class="table-container"><table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>en</th>
<th>gloss</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>the milk was spilled by Fred</td>
<td><span class="gloss">Fred</span> <span class="gloss">back</span> <span class="gloss">do</span> <span class="gloss">spill</span> <span class="gloss">cow-water</span></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Fred spilled the milk</td>
<td><span class="gloss">Fred</span> <span class="gloss">back</span> <span class="gloss">do</span> <span class="gloss">spill</span> <span class="gloss">cow-water</span></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Who was the milk spilled by?</td>
<td><span class="gloss">what</span> <span class="gloss">person</span> <span class="gloss">back</span> <span class="gloss">do</span> <span class="gloss">spill</span> <span class="gloss">cow-water</span>?</td>

<tr>

<td><span class="gloss">what</span> <span class="gloss">person</span> <span class="gloss">back</span> <span class="gloss">do</span> <span class="gloss">spill</span> <span class="gloss">cow-water</span>?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td> <span class="wrong"> *It is calling someone my name </span> </td>
<td><span class="gloss">some</span> <span class="gloss">person</span> <span class="gloss">do</span> <span class="gloss">call</span> <span class="gloss">name</span> <span class="gloss">of</span> <span class="gloss">me</span></td>

<tr>
<td>Her nose likes being kissed</td>
<td><span class="gloss">face-point</span> <span class="gloss">of</span> <span class="gloss">this</span> <span class="gloss">do</span> <span class="gloss">enjoy</span> <span class="gloss-emph">some</span> <span class="gloss">do</span> <span class="gloss">kiss</span> [this]</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Her nose likes being kissed by me</td>
<td><span class="gloss">face-point</span> <span class="gloss">of</span> <span class="gloss">this</span> <span class="gloss">do</span> <span class="gloss">enjoy</span> <span class="gloss-emph">me</span> <span class="gloss">do</span> <span class="gloss">kiss</span> [this]</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table></div>



This last sentence is not grammatical in English, but it is normal in German!



</div></div>
<div class="section-h3"><div class="collapsible-header">“It”: Impersonal Aspect</div><div class="collapsible-content">
    Similar to the passive, the impersonal aspect is another way to avoid saying the subject. This comes up when there isn’t a subject, for instance for weather. With it is raining or it is dark, there is not really anything that the it refers to, excepting perhaps the universe itself. The only reason that “it” is added is because the grammar of the language demands some subject for the verb. In a language like Spanish, where subjects are not necessary, the subject is simply omitted: llueve means it rains. You can’t say  <span class="wrong">*él llueve</span> or something like that. Hebrew is the same (pro-drop).

Although grammarians tend to think of the impersonal aspect as different from the passive voice, the authors of this work contend that they are actually the same. The only difference is that for the impersonal aspect, one is forced to omit the subject because there isn’t a subject, whereas for the passive, you choose to, because you don’t know who the subject is (or don’t want to say).

What do we do in Trevorese? We just use <span class="gloss">this,</span> in the sense of “this all is raining”. You can think of this use of “this” as someone gesturing in front of them and saying “all of this”.

In some cases, using <span class="gloss">this</span> may seem ambiguous, if there is already another <span class="gloss">this</span> in the sentence, for instance a person. For instance, imagine we are talking about some guy:

<div class="section-h3"><div class="collapsible-header">Animacy</div><div class="collapsible-content">
Many languages treat nouns differently depending on whether they are animate (e.g. animals) or not (e.g. rocks), and may even have different articles. English uses the animate/inanimate distinction for some words, e.g. who vs what, him vs it, someone vs. something, young vs new. Trevorese does not make this distinction in any cases, but if clarity is needed, “thing” or “being” can be added in:

<div class="section-h3"><div class="collapsible-header">“It”/“you”/“They”: “People”</div><div class="collapsible-content">
They say that this “passive”/“impersonal” phenomenon is a deep conspiracy that cuts across all pronouns. It’s everywhere. You can’t get away from it. Whether one recognizes it or not, the spectrum of impersonal phenomena extends deep into the language…or so it is said.

In reality, you can just translate these however you want. Just listing them here for completeness:

<ul><li>It is generally believed that X</li><li>you never know what’s going to happen</li><li>You know what they say</li><li>People are worried</li></ul>
Hebrew: “they say” but with pro-drop. Prodrop implies third if no context.

<div class="section-h3"><div class="collapsible-header">Yes and no</div><div class="collapsible-content">
Trevorese has one word for yes and one word for no:
<div class="table-container"><table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>en</th>
<th>gloss</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>Are you happy?</td>
<td><span class="gloss">you</span> <span class="gloss">like</span> <span class="gloss">happy</span> <span class="gloss">what</span>?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>yes.</td>
<td><span class="gloss">truth</span></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>no.</td>
<td><span class="gloss">no</span></td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table></div>



These are the same as the words for “correct” and “incorrect”:

<div class="table-container"><table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>en</th>
<th>gloss</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>Are you happy?</td>
<td><span class="gloss">you</span> <span class="gloss">like</span> <span class="gloss">happy</span> <span class="gloss">what</span>?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>correct.</td>
<td><span class="gloss">truth</span></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>incorrect.</td>
<td><span class="gloss">no</span></td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table></div>



English speakers or Spanish speakers may be confused as to why this gets its own section. How complex can “yes” and “no” be? However, “yes” and “no” are by no means a common phenomenon in language. Latin, Irish, Chinese, Toki Pona, and many others have no word for yes or no: they just repeat the verb. Hence why you see in Hiberno English, whose substrate is irish, exchanges like the following

<ul><li>do you want tea?<ul><li>I do. (Not “yes”)</li></ul></li></ul>
There are also many languages with more than two words for yes or no. French uses the word si when saying yes and contradicting something. German uses the word doch to contradict the thing that was just said, so it can mean either yes or no depending on the context. Older English had four words: TODO. Child English also has four: yes, no, yuh-huh, nuh-huh. (Note that these are different from “m-hm” and “m-m”, which are forms of “u-huh” and “uh-uh”, which simply mean “yes” and “no”.)

In Trevorese, if you want to emphasize that you are contradicting a statement, you can add “but” before it:

In English, there are a variety of bespoke verbs to verbify different nouns. For instance, you <b>play</b> a violin, you <b>do</b> pushups, you <b>sing</b> a song. In Trevorese, these are all omitted. You just use the <span class="gloss">do</span> particle to indicate that it is a verb:
