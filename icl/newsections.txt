I am working on a language called Sesowi. I want you to help me write a few more sections. I'm going to give you a tutorial introducing the language and its grammar, a full dictionary, and finally some stories in the language. 

Sesowi is a language for everyone, everywhere, to learn. Unlike previous attempts at this, which are largely European languages in disguise, Sesowi is a universal common denominator, equally easy for people of all backgrounds. All Sesowi words are composed of only 115 atomic concepts -- for instance, "snake" is langboi (long animal), lizard is kolangboi (arm-snake), and salamander is lokolangboi (water-lizard) -- and yet Sesowi is a complete language. Finally, Sesowi does not take itself too seriously.

Sesowi is meant to be the simplest possible language to learn, that is nonetheless fully capable of expressing any idea. It rides on the principles of simplicity and neutrality: not only is it easy to learn (simplicity), but it is easy to learn for speakers of all languages, and doesn't give an advantage to people with a particular native language (neutrality/universality).

Wait, Hasn’t this been tried before? There have been a variety of attempted IALs (International Auxiliary Languages) over the years, most famously Esperanto. However, these all do not satisfy the basic criteria of universalty and neutrality. Well known IALs include Esperanto, Volupek, Interlingua, Interlingue, Ido, Novial, Lingua Franca Nova, and Idiom Neutral, all of which are essentially simplified versions of Latin. They have their own beauty, but they are far from universal. Even ones attempting to be more global, like Lingwa di Planeta, still have a fundamentally Indo-European phonology and structure. And Lojban is explicitly stated to be impossible to learn perfectly. All of these leave non European speakers — namely the majority of the world — at a heavy social disadvantage. Sesowi is a more global middle ground, positioned somewhere between Indo-European and Sinitic languages, with influence from Dravidian languages.

There is, however, one language that does satisfy all these criteria, and very well at that: Toki Pona. Toki pona is a work of art done by someone with a deep and universal understanding of languages. However, it has no intention of being an IAL. Toki Pona is not capable of expressing many basic concepts (like “seven”), and its goal is more personal discovery than communication -- for example, it cannot express the concept of a "bad friend", sine a "friend" is just a "good person".

Sesowi grammar is uninflecting and relies on word order and part-of-speech markers. It does away with any grammatical element that is not deemed necessary for communication, e.g. tenses, moods like the conditional, animacy, case systems, and gender. It is phonologically simple, lacking tricky elements like consonant clusters, final consonants, or rhotics. Needless to say, there are no grammatical exceptions, or nonsense around spelling.

Much of the beauty of Sesowi is in its lexicon. Sesowi words themselves are more like a vague cloud of meaning, having a wide range of meanings, and a single word is often not clear without context. Importantly, these words do not have a specific part of speech, functioning as verb, noun, or adjective depending on grammatical role. There are only a few hundred of these atoms, but the language makes extensive use of compounding to make more complex concepts.

Now, here is the full dictionary of Sesowi words and definitions:

Here are some example stories written in Sesowi:


~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
___
na igomang de nitai	Night Visitors
odisa du yo maubwa so wi.	Odis has a little cat door.
kagu de i ne dabau, gewai i du yau dai maubwa du go tu ne, du ka kagu de i.	His food is inside the house, so he has to use the cat door to go inside and eat his food.	Note: 1) "kagu de i [du bi] ne...] 2)this "he *has to* *do X* and *do Y*", aka "modal to verb and verb" construction in English is quite odd...means "modal to verb, and having done that, verb"
natai, odisa du ka wina kagu, dana tai.	normally, Odis eats a small amount of food many times a day.	Note: note how "na" makes this countable: "dana tai" is "many times"; "da tai" is "much time"
yo tai, mi du meng i wating du ka wano kagukwai!	Sometimes, I think he only eats ten kibbles!
geng nutai mi du si, kagu de i du go nosi so kwi!	but recently, I have seen that his food has disappeared very quickly!
laiting, mi du si kabau de i no du bi ne lu so natai, geng du bi winai maubwa.	Also, I see that his bowl is not in its normal place, but instead is close to the cat door.
mi yau du bu we du pumeng, e du swadu!	I have to figure out a way to learn what is happening!
gewai, mi du obu app so du nang mi du du naise de mi tu siduting.	So i found an app that lets me make my phone into a camera.	Note: Note the construction "du du X tu Y" == "to make X into Y"
mi du lu do naise winai maubwa, du kunobwa maubwa, lai du lubi tu du si e be du swadu.	I put two phones near the cat door, locked the cat door, and waited to see what would happen.
betai, mi du pingtai.	afterwards, I went to sleep.
a nitai, dana ting du swadu!	Many things happened that night!
na wa ting du swadu witai be menitai.	The first thing happened shortly after midnight.
mau so wanglayang du swasi!	An orange cat appeared!
mi ya du sa ne i lu wano daswetai, geng i du bi na wa tai so mi du si i mau.	I have lived here for ten years, but this is my first time seeing this cat.	Note: note: English perfect tense is translated with "ya", aka "I have already lived here for ten years..."
na do ting du bi, wikuliboi du swasi!	The second thing was that a raccoon appeared!
i du oka kagu de odisa.	He ate up Odis' food.
pauting, odisa swa du swasi.	Finally, Odis himself appeared.
kagu so nosi, maubwa so nobwa.	The food was gone, the cat door was closed.
i du si so kebegameng.	He looked disappointed.

odisa du bi mang so du yo dana omeng so dawe.	Odis is someone who has many important decisions.
o nutai i du tau tu ta yotingpingting.	Every morning he jumps onto the table.
ta yotingpingting du yo do lobau de lo.	There are two cups of water on the table.
o do du bi lo tu mau.	Both of them are water for the cat.
odisa du tau, du ogo tu me i do bau.	Odis jumps and arrives in-between these two cups.	Note: "du ogo lu me" or "du ogo tu lu me" would also work
i du si tu wa bau.	He looks at one cup.
betai, i du si tu lai bau.	Then, he looks at the other cup.
i du meng so da ku, po dono wiwitai.	He thinks very hard, maybe for 20 seconds.
so pau, i du omeng.	In the end, he decides.
i kai du loka lo de wa lobau.	He starts to drink from one cup.
wina wiwitai be, i du nogo, du laitu to, du loka de lai lobau.	A few seconds later, he stops, turns his head, and drinks from the other cup.
i swadu du lailai mena witai.	This phenomenon continues for several minutes.
mi du emeng so da, i mau du meng e ting.	I really wonder what this cat is thinking.
i du omeng e we??	How does he decide??
i du meng e ting??	What is he thinking about??
i du bu e ting?	What is he looking for?
i du obu e na pauting?	What conclusions does he reach?
na mau du ge mina dana kumeng.	Cats give us much knowledge.
geng ne i biting, mi no du kumeng, i du ge mina e kumeng.	But in this case, I don't know what knowledge he has given us.


___
so da yodanating	Very busy	Note: modal practice; used: dwa yau bu=try nang should continue nang=allow
du yo tai so odisa so gali so da, du ping lu suting, du nang mang du pingpi i.	Sometimes, Odis is very happy and lies on the ground, allowing people to pat him.	Note: "sometimes" = "du yo tai" ("There are times")
geng lai na tai, i mau du yo ting so dawe so i dwa du.	But other times, he has important things he has to do.
i na tai, yu lailai nang bu du pingpi i.	These times, you can still try to touch him.
no du bi biting, so i no yau yu du i ting.	It's not the case that he doesn't want you to do this.
geng dapo so i no be pau du kogo.	But it's likely he won't stop walking.
tai i du yo ting so dawe so i dwa du, i no du yo tai du lai ting.	When he has important things to do, he doesn't have time for other things.
yu no dwa du nogali bi i no du nogo.	You shouldn't be sad if he doesn't stop.	Note: note: in English we have "feel bad", which would literally be "do energy bad-energy". But this is redundant; we can just say "do bad-energy".
i mau du bi boi so yodanating.	This cat is a busy animal.
mi swa no du kumeng i dwa du e na ting!	I myself don't know what things he needs to do!
geng ina dwa du bi so dawe so da.	But they must be very important.
bi yu yau so da du pingpi i, yu nang du dai wigaka du deli i du igo.	If you want to touch him, you can use a treat to entice him to come.

i du yau e ting?	What does he want?
i swa du yau ting e?	Do they even want anything?
so po, i nomai du li yau so opo ne salokwai de i.	Maybe, he feels a general desire inside his heart.
no du bi yau so walu, nomai du bi li so opo.	It's not a specific desire, just a general feeling.
mau du li ting so opo, gewai du sang.	The cat feels something, and therefore meows.
so danatai, mitwiboi du bi so wawe.	Often, humans are the same.
gwai swa du bi, bi mitwiboi du li ting, mina so o tai du dwemeng so du kumeng wai du bi e ting.	The difference only is, when a human feels something, we always think we know what the reason is.
tai swa mitwiboi du li ting, mitwiboi du bu wai.	As soon as a human feels something, they look for a reason.
geng i wai so mina du obu natai no du bi wai so dwe.	But this reason is usually not the true reason.
tai mina du li so noga, mina dwa du pumeng e we du se tu mang so dama, swa bi mina no du kumeng wai du li i we.	When we feel bad, we must learn how to talk to our loved ones, even if we do not know why we are feeling this way.

se so dwe: tadwemang de aisaka	A true story: the god of Isaac
tai mi du go tu ayalang, go de mi so langku.	When I went to Ireland, my journey was arduous.
mi dwa du nopingtai nutai so tamai, du go so pingtai tu kigolu.	I had to wake up too early and go sleepily to the airport.

tai mi du ogo lai kigolukwai, mi du twase tu ina, biting de mi du bi e.	When I arrived at the other terminal, I explained to those guys what my situation was.

nokwekwepe	Random Coping Chess
tai mi du bi ne dapumenglu, mi du sa ne dabaukwai ba lai mang.	When i was at university, I lived in a room with another person.
i lai mang du swase lamang.	This person's name was Raman.
i du bi mamang so winai de mi.	He was a close friend of mine.
do pingtailu de mina du bi lu sai laiswa.	Our two beds were side-by-side.
mina du pingtai ne tu so gengwe: to de mi lu gokopau de i; gokopau de i lu to de mi.	We slept in opposite directions: my head was at his feet and his feet were at my head.	Note: tricky prepositions rear their heads: "to sleep IN a direction". I decided to use the same preposition as in English, but it doesn't feel like a good fix
tai mina kai du pingtai, mina du se meng tu laiswa so mina du meng so yaumeng.	As we fell asleep, we would talk to each other about the ideas that we found interesting.
wa nitai so i, mina du nubi pe.	One such night, we invented a game.
mina ma du pe kwepe.	We liked to play chess.
geng a tai o mina kai du meng, kwepe no mai so da pe.	But both of us had started to feel that chess wasn't that fun anymore.
bi mina du nonawa, du meng swa no so dameng.	If we lost, we felt like we were not intelligent.
laiting, kwepe no so sa so dwe.	Also, chess is not like real life.
sa so dwe du yo dana ting so nonangbesi.	Real life has many unpredicatable events.
pauting, kwepe so ta nopeli.	Finally, chess is too serious.
sa so dwe ya so ta nopeli.	Real life is already too serious.
mina du yau pe de mina o du bi so peli!	We want our games to be all fun!	Note: todo: I really need to resolve the "du bi" question for adjectives
gewai, mina du nubi pe so nu, so swase "nokwekwepe".	Therefore, we invented a new game called "Random Coping Chess".
nokwekwepe du kai so wawe tu kwepe	Random Coping Chess starts out like chess.
geng na le de pe kai du gwai so nokwi.	But the rules of the game slowly begin to change.
po, swegwadi du swadu, o pekwai de yu du gwadi tu wa sai de pingting.	Maybe a landslide happens, and all your pieces slide to one side of the board.
laiting koyote du swasi, du ting so nokwe so opo.	Or a coyote appears and wreaks general havoc.	Note: wreaks general havoc = "does all manner of random things"
mina du meng i meng du bi meng so pe so da, du pingtai so gali.	We thought this was a very fun idea, and went to sleep happily.
baitai so be, mina du se i meng tu lai na mamang.	the next day, we told other friends about this idea.
wa mamang, teba, du ma i meng so walu.	one friend, Trevor, espcially liked this idea.
mi dapo du noyameng i meng, bi no du bi dasali de i.	I would probably have forgotten about this idea were it not for his enthusiasm.
wina nitabai be, na mamang de lamang du yo baibai bamangting tu i.	A few months later, Raman's friends had a goodbye party for him.
ya i bamangting, teba bemeng du du nokwekwepe tu dweting.	Before this party, Trevor planned to make Random Coping Chess a reality.
i ba aisaka du nubi google slide ting, kai du nubi pingpeting tu pe.	He and Isaac made a Google Slide deck and started making cards for the game.
geng teba so nose du tuli i na pingpeting.	But Trevor secretly printed these cards.	Note: note: adverb before verb
i du bwali o mang de a lu!	This surprised everyone there!
tai so be, lamang go du sa lu sai so tudo de lelu.	Afterwards, Raman went off to live on the east coast of the country.	Note: "go" in the modal construction
geng nokwekwepe no du pau.	But Random Coping Chess did not die.
ting so dwe, i ya du kai so swa.	In fact, it was only just beginning.	Note: "so swa" is a bit of an odd way to say "just" ....
a daswetai, teba du go o baitai du si aisaka, du pe i pe.	That year, Trevor came every day to see Isaac and play this game.	Note: "go" in the modal construction but with separating clause, therefore double "du"
dasali de teba so dukwang, du ge aisaka li so wawe.	Trevor's enthusiasm was infectious, and gave Isaac the same energy.
aisaka du kai o baitai du nubi pepingting so nu.	Isaac started making new cards every day.	Note: "kai" in the modal construction but with separating clause, therefore double "du"
tai i kai du pingtai, tai i du donosaigoting tu kudulu, i nomai du meng nokwekwepe.	As he was falling asleep, as he was biking to work, he only thought about Random Coping Chess.	Note: TBH I feel like you can put the "du" anywhere you want in a modal chain: "tai i du kai pingtai"/"tai i kai du pingtai" both sound good
o de setai, aisaka du begameng setaipau, tai i nang du pe wa pe so kwa metai lang.	The whole week, Isaac was looking forward to the weekend, when he could play a single, four-hour long game.	Note: note "o setai" is "all weeks"; "o de setai" is "all of the week"
aisaka du meng, i du bi po so watwi du meng so ku lai du eta, geng tai so watwi du noleng o swadali de i.	Isaac thought that this was a unique opportunity to think hard and compete, but at the same time let go of his pride.
teba du se so danatai, du meng i ting nang du gemeng, ewe du koyo na ting so nokwe so ku so du swadu ne sa de mang.	Trevor often said that he thought this can teach how to cope with the random and difficult things that happen in one's life.
aisaka du ma i meng, geng du wipomeng i nang du i ting so dwedwe.	Isaac liked this idea, but was uncertain that this could actually do this.	Note: note again: adverb must go after verb, or else it seems to apply to the oun
geng aisaka no du kumeng so a tai swa, teba du sa swadu so ku so da.	But Isaac didn't know then that at that very time, Trevor was experiencing an extremely difficult event.
muda de i atai swa du nosa.	His mother had just died.
i pe so dawe tu aisaka.	This game was important to Isaac.
geng i pe so ta dawe tu teba.	But this game was more important to Trevor.

                <p>Many languages treat nouns differently depending on whether they are animate (e.g. animals) or not (e.g. rocks), and may even have different articles.

Sesowi does not make this distinction in any cases, but if clarity is needed, <span class="gloss">thing</span> or <span class="gloss">person</span> can be added in:</p>

                <p>English speakers or Spanish speakers may be confused as to why this gets its own section. How complex can “yes” and “no” be? However, “yes” and “no” are by no means a common phenomenon in language. Latin, Irish, Chinese, Toki Pona, and many others have no word for yes or no: they just repeat the verb. Hence why you see in Hiberno English, whose substrate is irish, exchanges like the following:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>do you want tea?</li>
                    <li>I do. (Not “yes”)</li>
                </ul>
                <p>There are also many languages with more than two words for yes or no. French uses the word <b>si</b> when saying yes and contradicting something. German uses the word doch <b>to</b> contradict the thing that was just said, so it can mean either yes or no depending on the context. Older English had four words: yea/nay/yes/no. Child English also has four: yes, no, yuh-huh, nuh-huh. (Note that these are different from “m-hm” and “m-m”, which are forms of “u-huh” and “uh-uh”, which simply mean “yes” and “no”.)</p>
                <p>In Sesowi, if you want to emphasize that you are contradicting a statement, you can add <span class="gloss">against</span> (“but”) before it:</p>

              <p>The "perfect" tense is common in Indo-European languages, and uses the auxiliarly verb (“have”)<sup><a href="#fn:1" id="fnref:1">1</a></sup> to mark it, as in the sentence “I have been to Germany” or “More people have been to Berlin than me”. All this is really conveying is that the action has, indeed, happened at least once, and likely many times, in contrast to a statement like “I went to Germany”, which just means you went a particular time. So in effect, the perfect is just saying that you went some time(s). And that indeed is how the Sesowi expresses it, as we have just seen.</p>

              <p>We have just learned how to express that something has happened at least once. What id you want to express that it is a <b>habitual action</b>, or has happened many times?  Just use <span class="gloss">number-time</span> (aka "multiple times")!</p>

              <p>English also has the curiously named tense, the pluperfect (the “had verbed” tense). This is specifically used for things that happened in the past and were already completed before another thing happened in the past — it’s kind of like “the past with respect to the past”. However, there is also a much simpler way of expressing the same thing in English: “already”. Sesowi takes this approach, with <span class="gloss">back</span>:</p>

              <p>The future-within-past in English has to be expressed with this rather cumbersome “were going to” construction, or the verb “would” which is ambiguous because “would” also has the separate meaning of the conditional mode.</p>

              <p>The last form is the simplest and most natural -- it's just like saying "the apple that fall". However, in some cases this becomes ambiguous. For example, if you associate the word "eat" with an apple, you assume that means that this means that the apple is <b>eaten</b>, but if you associate it with a bear, you assume that it is the one doing the eating. If you need to be explicit, you can use the explicit form above, or the passive <span class="gloss">life</span> construction:</p>

              <p>Note: the “sing” in “if you sing, I will hear you”, even though it looks like the present tense, is actually in the future. Sesowi treats it as such.</p>

              <h4>The Subjunctive</h4>
              <p>The subjunctive happens when there is something that is happening counterfactually. For instance, in none of the sentences “If you were to come”, “If you had come”, and “I hope you come” did you actually come. Many languages, for instance Indo-European languages, have all sorts of complex ways of dealing with this situation. Sesowi, like Chinese, Telugu, Toki Pona, and so on, sidesteps this and leaves them ambiguous:</p>

              <p>Note that the second part of the clause would be, in English, in the conditional. Conditional and subjunctive go together like bread and butter! But as we already established, there is no conditional in Sesowi, so the second half of the clause is just in normal indicative.</p>
              <p>Now, in some cases, the fact that the subjunctive and the indicative are the same may be annoying. The default interpretation is that we are talking about a subjunctive event. If we really need to clarify, we can add “in fact” to be clear that the statement is in the indicative:</p>

          <div class="collapsible-header">“It”: Passive voice</div>
          <div class="collapsible-content">
              <p>The passive is a somewhat unusual construction that crops up in some form or other in many languages. It can either be used to omit a subject, or to take responsibility away from them. Let’s look at the first example first. Irish has its own conjugation, e.g. “déartear” – it is said. German uses even more “it: than English, e.g. “It gonged”, “It is whispered in the ear”. Spanish, Hebrew, and others just leave off the subject from the sentence. In short: any language needs some way to have sentences that don’t have a clear subject. Consider the following sentence:</p>
              <ul>
                  <li>the milk was spilled</li>
              </ul>
              <p>All this is saying is that someone or something spilled the milk, but the speaker is not saying who -- it's just <span class="en"><i>some</i>one</span> or <span class="en"><i>some</i>thing</span>. Sesowi uses a generic noun, equivalent to saying "Someone spilled the milk", but can also leave off the subject entirely:</p>

              <p>Now, what about the version of the passive that has a subject attached to it?</p>
              <ul>
                  <li>the milk was spilled by Fred</li>
              </ul>
              <p>The only difference between this construction (passive+"by") and the active voice is that it takes some responsibility away from Fred. This distinction doesn’t add much to the expressivity of the language, and can safely be removed. As such, Sesowi just uses the active voice in these constructions:</p>

          <div class="collapsible-header">“It”: Impersonal Aspect</div>
          <div class="collapsible-content">
            <p>Similar to the passive, the impersonal aspect is another way to avoid saying the subject. This comes up when there isn’t a subject, for instance for weather. With <i>it is raining</i> or <i>it is dark</i>, there is not really anything that the <i>it</i> refers to, excepting perhaps the universe itself. The only reason that “it” is added is because the grammar of the language demands some subject for the verb. In a language like Spanish, where subjects are not necessary, the subject is simply omitted: llueve means it rains. You can’t say <span class="wrong">*él llueve</span> or something like that. Hebrew is the same (pro-drop).</p>
              <p>Although grammarians tend to think of the impersonal aspect as different from the passive voice, the authors of this work contend that they are actually the same. The only difference is that for the impersonal aspect, one is forced to omit the subject because there isn’t a subject, whereas for the passive, you choose to, because you don’t know who the subject is (or don’t want to say).</p>
              <p>What do we do in Sesowi? We can omit the subject, as in the passive, or use <span class="gloss">this</span>, in the sense of “this all is raining”. You can think of this use of “this” as someone gesturing in front of them and saying “all of this”.</p>

              <p><strong>Comparative Linguist's corner:</strong> this formation of questions is extremely common across the world's languages, from Singlish (ma) to Japanese (か), although it is not always the final position, as in Turkish "mi", which follows the predicate. Even English has this to some degree, e.g. "you're a bit big for this now, eh?".</p>

              <p>As in most languages, you can leave off the "you"/ <span class="gloss">you</span> for a command:</p>

              <p>These words are very powerful when combined with the quantifiers ! Let's see what happens when we combine them with the question word <span class="gloss">what</span>:</p>

              <p>Look closely at these. In English, we have so many different words for these concepts, and it hides how similar they all are! It is common for a language to be like English in this way, and have some collection of concepts from different roots and languages, such that the true structure is hidden. However, several other languages actually make these relations perfectly clear — for instance Telugu, what uses exactly the structure described above!</p>

          <div class="collapsible-content">
              <p>We have seen how to use a verb with a noun as its object:<br />
                  <b>normal verb:</b> <span class="english">I see a dog</span> (the object of the verb <span class="english">see</span> is the noun <span class="english">dog</span>)<br />
                  Now let's talk about verbs that act on other verbs, which we can call "modal verbs":<br />
                  <b>modal verb:</b> <span class="english">I can sing</span> (the object of the <i>modal verb</i> <span class="english">can</span> is the <i>verb</i><span class="english">sing,</span>)
              </p>
              <p>The most common verbs that act on other verbs are a set of five or so verbs that actually can ONLY<sup><a href="#fn:1" id="fnref:1">1</a></sup> take verbs as objects. For instance, <span class="english">I can sing</span> works, but <span class="english">I can the cat</span> has no meaning. These obligate modals almost always work in funny and particular ways in a language.<sup><a href="#fn:2" id="fnref:2">2</a></sup> Here is their use in Sesowi:</p>

              <p>Note that in Sesowi, as in English, <span class="gloss">can</span> can mean both "can" and "may", and <span class="gloss">must</span> can mean "should" or "must".</p>

              <p>Then there are a lot of other verbs that can act on verbs OR nouns. In English/German/etc., these are treated differently; in Sesowi they are the same as the so-called "true modals":</p>

              <p>Verbs that act on other verbs are incredibly powerful, and capture all the different ways you can perform a noun – including tense! When we told you about tenses before, we only told you half the story. What we didn't tell you is that the two tense markers we taught you — <span class="gloss">back</span> and <span class="gloss">front</span> — are in fact themselves just a special case of verbs acting on verbs. Observe:</p>

              <p>All these constructions are all formed the same way! And indeed, in Sesowi, there is no difference between "tenses" and "modal verbs". The concept of a "tense" as it is usually conceived is based on how Indo-European languages work, where tenses are treated in a special way, but modals are treated more like verbs. However, in other languages, it's not so. In Chinese, Vietnamese, or Malay, tenses are expressed as adverbs, and in Telugu, tenses and modals are in the same category of suffixes!</p>

              <p>Reminder: every verb has exactly one <span class="gloss">do</span>. It sticks to the main verb like a prefix, and other things, like modals or tenses, line up before it without a <span class="gloss">do</span> of their own.</p>

              <p>This is the same story for any verb that can take a noun or a verb as its object, like "try", "like", "need", etc.</p>

              <h4>More verbs acting on Verbs: the "Instrumental case"</h4>
              <p>Many languages have a special way of marking things when they are being used to do something. Sesowi, like Chinese, simply uses "use". It is just another case of a verb acting on another verb.</p>

              <p>However, you can also add a second object with a preposition like <b>to</b> or <b>at.</b> This second object is called the indirect object. Just as English, Sesowi marks these with the preposition "to" (aka <span class="gloss">direction</span>)</p>

              <p>When speaking, we need some way to differentiate between these two objects. For example, "give me to the girl" and "give me the girl" are very different sentences. To an English speaker, this should be pretty straightforward: you just indicate the recipient of the verb phrase with <span class="gloss">direction</span>. Why is it worth mentioning? First of all, other languages treat indirect objects differently (e.g. with the Dative case). Second of all, English has another way of marking the indirect object, just by using the word order:</p>

              <p>In Sesowi, you can never omit the preposition <span class="gloss">direction</span> for the indirect object.</p>
              <p>There are a few verbs in English that use "to" even when it appears to be a direct object. For instance, you talk <b>to someone</b>. However, in these cases this is because there is an implied indirect object: when you talk to someone, you are actually saying words (the direct object) to someone (the indirect object). The situation is the same for Sesowi: for these verbs with implied objects, we use the preposition <span class="gloss">direction</span>:</p>

              <p>This point should not pose problems for speakers of English: they should just translate "to" into <span class="gloss">direction</span>. This should be familiar also to speakers of Chinese, where <span class="gloss">direction</span> can be interpreted as 对: one can see that above, the treatment of <span class="english">to talk</span> is the same as Chinese 说 vs 说对.</p>
              <p>Note 1: In Chinese, there is the exact same phenomenon, where if there is no particle, the first object is the indirect object and the second is direct (I give you a thing / 我给你一个东西). if you invert the order of the objects but want the same meaning, you need to add a particle (I give a thing <b>to</b> you / 我<b>把</b>一个东西给你). However, instead of marking the indirect object, Chinese marks the direct object.</p>
              <p>Note 2: Interestingly, in English there are also verbs where you are not allowed to use the word order, and you have to use a preposition. Consider the word <span class="english">say.</span> While you can say <span class="english">Give me the cat</span>, you can't say <span class="wrong">*Say me the thing</span>.</p>

              <p>Another situation where IE languages use an infinitive or gerund is when you are referring to the general state of a verb, as in "walking is good" or "It is good to walk." In this case, the verb has become a sort of noun, meaning "the state of walking". In Sesowi, we just need to add the "do" to show that it is a verb, and then you can use it like any other noun:</p>

              <p>If you speak a European language, you may think this will cause ambiguity. However, many of the world's languages, Like Indonesian, Chinese, Vietnamese, Balinese, etc. get along fine without separate plural forms! If there is any ambiguity you can use a <b>quantifier</b> to be extra clear. We have already seen the quantifiers <span class="gloss">this</span> (this) and <span class="gloss">that</span> (that), which are singular by default. Let's introduce two more quantifiers: <span class="gloss">number</span> (plural/group) to explicitly mark the plural, and <span class="gloss">one</span> (one), which is literally just the number <span class="english">one</span>, and can be used to unambiguously mark the singular.</p>

              <p>You may notice that <span class="gloss">this</span> means both he / she, as well as “this”! Therefore, the following are all valid translations, and need context to tell apart:</p>

          <div class="collapsible-header">Prepositions</div>
          <div class="collapsible-content">
              <p>Prepositions are words that say how two things are related. For instance, you can say that the dog is <span class="english">behind</span> the cat, <span class="english">over</span> the cat, <span class="english">in</span> the cat, <span class="english">for</span> the cat; or that it is woofing <span class="english">at</span> the cat, or <span class="english">with</span> the cat, or <span class="english">by</span> the cat.</p>
              <p>Sesowi has three "true" prepositions: <span class="gloss">of</span> (of/from), <span class="gloss">direction</span> (to; literally 'direction'), and <span class="gloss">with</span> (with). All location or movement prepositions are expressed with nouns saying what the location/direction is. The following sections give details about how common prepositions are used, starting with the "true" prepositions, and then going into the prepositions of movement/location.</p>

              <h4>Possession with <span class="gloss">of</span> </h4>
              <p>Let’s start with <span class="gloss">of</span>, aka the word meaning <span class="english">belonging/possession</span>. This word indicates possession:</p>

              <p>The word <span class="gloss">with</span> is very straightforward. It is used just as <span class="english">with</span> or <span class="english">and</span> in English, to mean that two things are together:</p>

              <h4>Basic Prepositions of location/movement</h4>
              <p>There are no true prepositions in Sesowi – everything is ultimately a noun. When you would use a preposition to describe where something is in English, just use the noun for corresponding location in Sesowi. If a dog is <span class="english">on</span> the roof, you say that the dog is <b>top</b> the roof. If you are going <span class="english">to</span> the store, you are going <b>direction</b> the store; and if you are going <span class="english">from</span> the store, you are going <span class="gloss">of</span> the store. If the dog jumps <span class="english">onto</span> the roof, it jumps <b>direction</b> <b>top</b> the roof.</p>
              <p>English has a lot of prepositions for how two objects can be related. The snake can be <b>in front of</b> the dog, <b>near</b> the dog, <b>inside</b> the dog, <b>above</b> the dog, <b>on</b> the dog, or <b>by the side</b> of the dog. Some of these change if there is movement: for instance, after the snake goes <b>into</b> the dog it is <b>inside</b> the dog.</p>
              <p>In Sesowi, these prepositions are simply expressed as one of the basic prepositions of movement (usually <span class="gloss">direction</span>) plus the location relative to the object. Let’s look at a few examples. In these examples, we’ll break them up by whether the movement is static (happening in one location), or as a movement to- or from that location:</p>

              <h4>Temporal prepositions</h4>
              <p>Prepositions of time are expressed with the same words as those of space. Imagine yourself as a box where the future stretches out in front of you and the past behind. Now imagine that you yourself are an event in time. You see another event in the future, in front of you. This event happens <b>after</b> you in time — so in this spatial metaphor, it happens <b>in front of</b> you. You happen <b>before</b> it — so, spatially, you happen <b>behind</b> it. Say there is another event that starts before you and ends after you. You happen <b>during</b> that event — spatially, you happen <b>in</b> it. And if you (the event) started at the same time as the other event and continue on forwards in time — aka you happen <b>since</b> that event — spatially, you happen <b>starting</b> at that event.<sup><a href="#fn:1" id="fnref:1">1</a></sup></p>

              <h4>Prepositions in verb phrases</h4>
              <p>Many Indo-European verbs have prepositions built into them, and it causes considerable chaos for learners to master them. In Sesowi, these prepositions are generally absent:</p>

              <p>An exception is verbs that take indirect objects with the preposition <span class="english">to</span> or <span class="gloss">about</span>, like <span class="english">talk to</span> or <span class="english">talk about</span>. "to" is explained in the section on indirect objects, and "about" was explained in the <span class="gloss">of</span> section above.</p>
              <p>In some cases where English has different meanings for different prepositions, Sesowi has different verbs. In these cases you’ll notice that English also generally offers us easy synonyms:</p>

              <p>Notice however that even in English, <span class="english">believe in</span> has a different meaning when applied to God versus to me! Really, there is ambiguity everywhere in all languages, but context clears almost everything up!</p>

                    <p>Everything is pronounced more or less as in English. The only things to be careful of are:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Stress is on the first syllable ("SEH-so-wee" not "seh-SO-wee")</li>
                        <li>⟨e⟩ is closer to the vowel in "bed", and never makes the /i/ noise as in English. So <span class="surface">me</span> sounds like "meh", and <span class="surface">wise</span> is pronounced like "wee-seh".</li>
                        <li>⟨o⟩ is a single vowel, not a diphthong like in English. It is closer to the vowel in "b<b>o</b>y" or "m<b>o</b>le"</li>
                        <li>⟨ng⟩ is always like "si<b>ng</b>" and never like "fi<b>ng</b>er"</li>
                        <li>For a multi-syllabic word, don't get scared -- just pronounce it as the combination of its individual syllables! so <span class="surface">kutingmengwe</span> = <span class="surface">ku</span>-<span class="surface">ting</span>-<span class="surface">meng</span>-<span class="surface">we</span> = "koo-ting-meng-weh". </p></li>

                <p>There are around 114 basic words from which all other words are built. These are called atoms. They all have the form <b>consonant+vowel[+optional ng]</b>. The simplest atom would simply have <b>consonant+vowel</b>, e.g. <span class="surface">ma</span>, or <span class="surface">su</span>. Atoms representing slightly more complex concepts use more use of compound consonants, diphthongs, and the nasal coda, e.g. <span class="surface">yau</span>, <span class="surface">kwe</span>, or <span class="surface">nang</span>.</p>
                <p>There are four special atoms that start with a vowel, representing the most basic concepts of <span class="gloss">this</span>, <span class="gloss">that</span>, <span class="gloss">all</span>, and <span class="gloss">what</span>. These are usually not used in compound words.</p>

                <p>Atoms themselves have broader meanings than English words, and if they are used by themselves they can be ambiguous. In this way they are more like Chinese characters. For example, <span class="gloss">arm</span> has the default meaning of <span class="english">arm</span>, but it can also refer to the hand, or the leg, or any limb. If context is not sufficient, you can use the <b>explicit forms</b> or <b>disambiguation forms</b>:</p>

                <p><b>Note to English speakers:</b> A good number of the world's languages, e.g. Greek and Chinese, do not differentiate "hand" and "arm". So this level of ambiguity is quite natural!</p>

Now, I want you to write the following tutorial sections:

1. Explain "Transition Metal" Atoms: The dictionary uses this term for words like `kau` (cow). This is internal jargon. Explain it in the dictionary's introduction, e.g., "For pragmatic reasons, a few common but culturally specific concepts are included as atoms. We call these 'transition words'."
2. Conjunctions: A dedicated section on clausal conjunctions is needed, including geng, gewai, iwai, laiting and any others that come up in the stories
3. Numbers: describe the ten atoms used for numbers (no, wa, do, ... noi), and how to form longer numbers (19=wanoi, 20=dono, 21=dowa, ....), and how to use "ta" for "to the power of" (100=watado, 1000=watati, 2000=dotati, etc)
4. small section on Topic-Comment Structure
5. small section on Serial Verb Constructions.
6. Any other grammatic aspects that seem to be missing from the tutorial.

All sections you write should be succinct, describing the concept with one or two small tables of examples, and no unnecessary verbiage.
