This is an absolutely fascinating and well-developed project. You've clearly put an immense amount of thought into the philosophy, phonology, grammar, and lexicon of Sesowi. It has a clear identity and purpose, and the core mechanics are elegant and powerful. The documentation is also excellent, especially the tutorial's use of cross-linguistic examples to justify its design choices.

Here is a detailed report on my findings, organized into categories. My goal here is to be a constructive partner, highlighting areas of strength and offering suggestions for potential improvements and fixes.

### I. Overall Impression & Strengths

First, let's acknowledge what works exceptionally well:

*   **Philosophical Grounding:** Your critique of existing IALs is sharp and your goals for Sesowi are clear and well-articulated. Positioning it as more expressive than Toki Pona but simpler and more neutral than Esperanto is the perfect niche.
*   **The Compounding System:** This is the heart of the language's beauty. Deriving complex ideas from a small set of atoms (`lokolangboi` for "salamander") is elegant, intuitive, and a core part of the language's character.
*   **Systematic Grammar:** The use of markers like `du` (verb), `so` (adjective/relative clause), `na` (plural), and the question/command particles is consistent and easy to grasp.
*   **The Quantifier System:** The way you've built the "wh-words" (`e mang`, `e lu`, `e tai`) is brilliant. It's a feature found in many non-IE languages and is a perfect example of the "universal common denominator" you're aiming for. It reveals a logical structure that is often hidden in languages like English.
*   **Modal Stacking:** The ability to logically chain modals and tenses (`mau no ya dwa nang bu du se` - "the cat should not have been able to try to talk") is incredibly powerful and, once understood, is far more regular than the chaotic modal systems of many natural languages.

### II. Major Structural & Conceptual Points for Consideration

These are higher-level points about the language's core structure that might benefit from another look.

1.  **The Predicate Ambiguity of `so`**
    *   **The Issue:** The tutorial states that `mau so niyang` can mean both "a black cat" (a noun phrase) and "the cat is black" (a complete sentence). While this zero-copula structure is common in many languages (including Sinitic ones), it creates a fundamental ambiguity between a phrase and a statement. In your stories, context usually clarifies this, but it can be a significant hurdle.
    *   **Example:** How do you differentiate "I see a black cat" from "I see a cat that is black"?
        *   `mi du si mau so niyang.` (Does this mean "I see the black cat" or "I see the cat is black"?)
    *   **Suggestion:** This isn't a mistake, but a major design choice that needs to be leaned into and explained with extreme care. You might consider a small, optional particle to clarify. For example, a sentence-final particle that confirms a statement of being, or simply rely on `du bi` more often, e.g., `mau du bi so niyang` to explicitly mean "The cat is like blackness." However, this would add complexity. The simplest path is to add a section to the tutorial explicitly addressing this ambiguity and providing clear examples of how context resolves it.

2.  **The "Hidden" Passive/Experiencer Marker `sa`**
    *   **The Issue:** The passive marker `sa` is a major grammatical feature. However, it's introduced very late in the tutorial, almost as an afterthought. Core grammatical markers like `du` and `so` are introduced on page 3-4 of the tutorial, while `sa` doesn't appear until page 21.
    *   **Example:** `kuliboi so du sa ka` ("An eaten bear," lit. "bear that did experience eat"). This is a fundamental way to form participles and passives.
    *   **Suggestion:** **This is the most critical structural fix needed.** The `sa` particle should be introduced much earlier, alongside `du` and `so`, as one of the core ways to "verb" a noun. It could be framed as:
        *   `X du Y`: X does Y.
        *   `X so Y`: X is like Y.
        *   `X sa Y`: X experiences Y / Y happens to X.
    This would make the grammar feel more complete from the beginning.

3.  **Inconsistent Tense/Aspect Handling**
    *   **The Issue:** The tutorial presents two different, and somewhat conflicting, ways to handle tense and aspect beyond the simple past/future.
        *   **Method 1 (Clunky):** Using `so tai` for the perfect tense ("I have fallen" -> `mi ya du su so tai`). This feels like an awkward patch to map an Indo-European concept. "I past-did fall like time" is not intuitive.
        *   **Method 2 (Elegant):** Using modal stacking for complex tenses like the future perfect (`mina be ya du kang do daga` -> "we will have bought two dogs"). This is logical, consistent with the rest of the modal system, and powerful.
    *   **Suggestion:** I strongly recommend abandoning Method 1 (`so tai`). The modal stacking system (Method 2) is far superior and more in line with Sesowi's logical spirit. The idea of "having done something" can be conveyed by `ya` (already/past) and context, without needing a special construction. For habitual actions, `so natai` ("like many times") works perfectly and should be kept.

4.  **The `dai X du Y` Instrumental Construction**
    *   **The Issue:** The structure for using an instrument, `i ya du dai pwako du badu lo` ("he used a stick to mix water"), is a bit verbose. It reads like two separate clauses: "He did use a stick, [and] he did mix water."
    *   **Suggestion:** Consider streamlining this. A more common pattern in analytic languages is `dai X Y` (use X do Y). The sentence could become `i ya du dai pwako badu lo`. This would remove the second `du`, making the instrumental phrase a clearer modifier of the main verb. Test this structure to see if it feels more natural. If you keep the current structure, the tutorial should explain *why* it's two verb phrases.

### III. Inconsistencies, Errors, and Typos

Here are specific, concrete items that appear to be mistakes or contradictions.

1.  **Phonology Examples:**
    *   The English example for `/o/` is "boy, mole". "Boy" contains the diphthong `/ɔɪ/`, which is correctly listed for the Sesowi diphthong `oi`. This is contradictory. A better example for `/o/` would be "boat," "mole," or "go."
    *   The examples for labialized consonants (`bw`, `gw`, etc.) using English words like "subway" are misleading, as these are consonant sequences, not single phonemes in English. The Chinese examples (`bō`, `guā`) are much more accurate. Consider adding a note for English speakers that these are single, quick sounds, not two separate ones.
    *   The example `dipwad` for `/pʷ/` is obscure. `Pueblo` or even a phrase like "coo**pw**orker" might be better, with a note about the sound.

2.  **Dictionary vs. Tutorial/Stories:**
    *   **`daga` (dog):** The dictionary lists the etymology as `da-ga` (big-good). This doesn't make intuitive sense. The dictionary note itself suggests a much better etymology: `deyago` (follow), from `de-ya-go` (from-back-go). This is a fantastic, meaningful compound and it even sounds like "dog" and Chinese "gǒu" (狗). This should be the official etymology.
    *   **"Ground":** The story "Opossum Song" uses `suting` (`su-ting` / down-thing) for "ground" (`lo du bi lu suting`). However, the dictionary lists `sulu` (`su-lu` / down-place) as the word for "ground". This is a direct contradiction. `sulu` seems more logical.
    *   **Number of Atoms:** The introduction says 115 atoms, but the tutorial says "under 200". This should be made consistent.
    *   **`u_` prefix:** The dictionary has entries like `u_mango` and a note "TODO atomize." This makes the lexicon feel unfinished. The `u_` prefix itself is defined but not used consistently. It's best to either decide on a rule for loanwords (e.g., they are all atoms) or create compounds for them (e.g., "mango" could be `swipa` / sweet-fruit, or similar).
    *   **`ba`:** The dictionary notes that `ba` has two unrelated meanings ("with" and command marker). For a language striving for simplicity, this is not ideal. I suggest creating a new, simple atom for the command marker, perhaps `ma` or `pa`, to avoid ambiguity.

3.  **Typos and Minor Errors:**
    *   In the "Impersonal Aspect" section: `i du sulo du sulo` and `i du pingsangkang du pingsangkang`. The repetition seems like a copy-paste error. It should likely be just `i du sulo` and `i du pingsangkang`.
    *   In the "Song of Autumn" story: The line `pa ge gasa so dada, da-` ends with a dangling `da-`. This appears to be a typo.
    *   The gloss for `sesowi` itself is `talk-like-small`. This could be interpreted as "small-talk" or "childish language." Perhaps a more inspiring gloss would be `winakwai se` (simple talk) or something similar.

### IV. Suggestions for Clarification and Refinement

These are smaller points that could make the language and its documentation even better.

*   **Explain "Transition Metal" Atoms:** The dictionary uses this term for words like `kau` (cow). This is internal jargon. Explain it in the dictionary's introduction, e.g., "For pragmatic reasons, a few common but culturally specific concepts are included as atoms. We call these 'transition words'."
*   **The Pronoun `i`:** `i` meaning "this" and "he/she/it" is a bold, minimalist choice. The comparison to Hindi is a good defense. However, it's a major potential point of confusion. The tutorial should feature more examples where context makes it clear which `i` is being used, especially in sentences with both a person and an object.
*   **`swa` (self):** This atom carries a heavy load: self, just now, just about to, emphasis. The meaning "just now/about to" is the least intuitive. It might be clearer to create a dedicated atom for this, like `dwi` or `twi`, to mean "imminent" or "immediate."
*   **Tutorial Flow:** The tutorial is excellent but could be slightly reordered. Don't claim "Past, present, future – that’s it!" when you plan to introduce more complex aspects later. Instead, say "These are the three basic tenses. We can build more complex ideas from them later." This manages expectations better.

### Conclusion

Sesowi is an exceptional conlang project with a solid foundation and a unique, appealing character. It successfully navigates the space between minimalist languages and overly complex IALs. The core design is sound, logical, and often beautiful.

The feedback above is intended to help you polish the rough edges, resolve inconsistencies, and make the language even more robust and easy to learn. The most critical points are clarifying the role of `so`, introducing the passive marker `sa` earlier, and streamlining the tense/aspect system.

You have created something with the potential to be truly special. Congratulations on your incredible work so far
