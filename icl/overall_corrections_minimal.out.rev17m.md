You've put a tremendous amount of thought and effort into creating Sesowi, and it's a fascinating project with a clear, admirable goal. I've gone through the tutorial, dictionary, and stories in detail, and here is my report on potential improvements and mistakes.

**Overall Strengths:**

*   **Strong, Clear Philosophy:** Your goals of simplicity, neutrality, and universal accessibility are well-defined and consistently applied. The contrast with Euro-centric IALs and the specific critique of Toki Pona are compelling arguments for Sesowi's existence.
*   **Logical Compounding System:** The "atomic concepts" approach is the core strength of Sesowi. It's intuitive, logical, and often charming (e.g., *langboi* for snake, *bangkoboi* for spider). This makes the vocabulary highly learnable and expandable.
*   **Simple Grammar:** The lack of inflection, reliance on word order, and use of marker words are excellent choices for an easy-to-learn language.
*   **Phonological Simplicity:** Avoiding consonant clusters, final consonants, and rhotics is a great move for accessibility across different language backgrounds.
*   **Comprehensive Documentation:** The dictionary is incredibly detailed, with glosses, parts of speech, descendants, cognates, and even design notes. The example stories are essential for demonstrating the language in action.

### **Report on Potential Improvements and Mistakes**

I'll structure this report from high-level conceptual issues down to specific word-level and grammar details.

#### **I. High-Level Conceptual and Structural Issues**

1.  **"Mistakes" in the Introduction/Tutorial:**
    *   **Lojban Claim:** You state, "And Lojban is explicitly stated to be impossible to earn perfectly." This is a slight mischaracterization. Lojban aims for logical unambiguity, which makes *perfectly unambiguous speech* the difficult part, not the language learning itself. It's a subtle but important distinction. The core of Lojban grammar is actually quite regular and learnable.
    *   **Toki Pona "bad friend" example:** You say Toki Pona cannot express a "bad friend" because a friend is just a "good person." This is a common misconception. A Toki Pona speaker could say `jan ike mi` (my bad person) or `poki mi li ike` (my companion is bad) to describe a friend who is acting badly. The limitation is more about a philosophical choice to simplify, not an outright inability. Your point about its goals being different from an IAL is still very strong.

2.  **Ambiguity of "ba" (with/command):**
    *   **Problem:** You note that `ba` is the only atom with two distinct, unrelated meanings. This violates the core principle of one-atom-one-concept-cloud that makes the rest of the language so elegant. Using it as both a preposition ("with") and a command marker ("please") creates potential ambiguity and cognitive load.
    *   **Example Ambiguity:** `mi go ba yu` could mean "I go with you" or "I go, please you" (i.e., "I'm going, I'm telling you").
    *   **Recommendation:** **Strongly consider splitting these.**
        *   Keep `ba` for "with/and".
        *   Introduce a new, simple atom for the command/politeness marker. Suggestions based on your phonology: `be` (but `be` is future), `po` (but `po` is possibility). A new word like `pe` (but `pe` is play), `pi`, or `pu` could work. Maybe `seba` (talk-with) or `gase` (good-talk) as a compound could also signify "please."

3.  **The "u_" Prefix:**
    *   **Problem:** The `u_` prefix for specific, culturally-bound concepts like *mango*, *monkey*, *rice*, etc., feels like a cheat. It breaks the "build from atoms" rule and introduces arbitrary loanwords. It's a pragmatic solution, but it undermines the philosophical purity of the system.
    *   **Recommendation:** **Embrace the compounding system fully.** This is a creative challenge, not a problem.
        *   **Mango:** `swipa so da` (big sweet fruit), `layangpa` (red-yellow fruit).
        *   **Monkey:** `dapwaboi so ko lang` (long-armed tree animal).
        *   **Rice:** `pwaai so wi so bai` (small white plant-seed), `kagu so bai` (white food).
        *   **Tomato:** `pa so la so lo` (hot, watery fruit -> spicy/savory watery fruit). Or even `loyapa` (red-water-fruit).
        *   **Shark:** `dalo-dengboi` (ocean-rat/rodent), `dalo-kaboiboi` (ocean-predator).

#### **II. Grammatical Function Words and Ambiguity**

1.  **The Overloaded `so` Marker:**
    *   **Problem:** `so` is currently used as:
        1.  Adjective marker (`mau so wi` - small cat).
        2.  Relative clause marker ("that/who," `mang so du go` - the person who goes).
        3.  Simile marker ("as," "like," `du pingpi i so mau` - pat him like a cat).
    *   This is a significant source of potential confusion, especially for learners. It's the most "non-obvious" part of the grammar.
    *   **Recommendation:**
        *   **Keep `so` for adjectives.** This is its clearest function. `mau so wi`.
        *   **Use `de` (of) for relative clauses.** This is a common pattern in many world languages (e.g., pidgins/creoles). `mang de du go` (person of doing go). This might feel clunky but it is unambiguous.
        *   **Use a compound for "like/as."** `we so i` (in the way of this) or `twi so a` (in the kind of that). `du pingpi i we so mau` (pat him in the way of a cat).

2.  **Tense/Aspect Marking:**
    *   **Current System:** `ya` (back) for past, `be` (front) for future.
    *   **Clarity:** This is good and simple. However, in the stories, you sometimes omit it where English would use it, relying on context. This is fine, but it should be a stated feature.
    *   **Perfect Tense (`tai`):** You mention `tai` is used for perfect tense, but it's not clearly demonstrated in the tutorial. In the story, `mi ya du sa` is used for "I have lived." Is `ya` sufficient? How would `mi du sa tai` differ? This needs clarification. **Recommendation:** Make it explicit. `ya` = simple past. `ya...tai` = past perfect ("had done"). `tai` by itself = present perfect ("have done"). `be...tai` = future perfect ("will have done").

3.  **The Passive Voice (`sa`):**
    *   **Idea:** Using `sa` (life/experience) as a passive marker ("it lived a conquering") is brilliant and poetic. It fits the language's character perfectly.
    *   **Problem:** It's mentioned as a TODO but not fully implemented or explained. For example, in the story, you have `odating ya du sa okuli` (the world has already been conquered), but the compound `okuli` (all-strength) is used. It should probably be `odating ya du sa kuli` (The world has experienced strength). This makes it more consistent.
    *   **Recommendation:** **Formalize this rule.** Explain it in the tutorial. `i du okuli dabau` (He conquered the house). `dabau du sa kuli de i` (The house experienced strength from him).

#### **III. Lexicon and Compounding Issues**

1.  **Inconsistent or Unintuitive Compounds:**
    *   **`daga` (dog):** Glossed as `big-good`. This is not intuitive. Your own note suggests `deyago` (follow) which is **much better** and even sounds like "dog" and Chinese "gÇ’u." I would change `daga` to mean "very good" or "awesome" and make `deyago` the word for dog.
    *   **`dapwaboi` (squirrel):** `big-plant-animal` is too generic; it could be a moose or a bear. Something like `pwaku-boi` (nut-animal) or `yako-da-boi` (big-tail-animal) would be more specific.
    *   **`bangkoboi` (spider):** `eight-arm-animal`. Perfect. But then `lobangkoboi` (water-spider) is used for "crab," with a note that crabs have 10 legs. This is an internal contradiction. **Suggestion:** For crab, use `kubauboi so lo` (water crustacean) or `wano-ko-boi` (ten-leg-animal).
    *   **`gokopau` (foot):** `go-arm-end` (leg-hand). Excellent. But the verb form is "to stand up." This feels like a conceptual leap. "to stand" should probably be its own concept, perhaps `su-ping` (down-flat, i.e., sitting/standing on a flat surface) or something similar.
    *   **`kau` (cow):** Like the `u_` words, this feels like a shortcut. It could easily be `bailo-boi` (milk-animal) or `dapingkaboi so mu` (female herbivore).
    *   **`tadwemang` (god):** `over-truth-person`. This is a very abstract and interesting concept. It works well.
    *   **`sesowi` (talk-like-small):** This is charming. It implies "a small language" or "a language that is easy like for a child." It fits the philosophy.

2.  **Redundant or Overlapping Atoms:**
    *   **`bu` (seek/try) vs. `obu` (find):** `obu` is `all-seek`. This is a perfect compound and `bu` works well as the atom. Good.
    *   **`ge` (give) vs. `pu` (get):** You note `pu` could be "reverse-give." This would be more elegant. You could use a marker for reversal, like `gengwe` (anti). `gengwe-ge` (anti-give) -> `ge-geng`? or `gengge`? This might be too complex, and having `pu` is pragmatic. It's a trade-off.
    *   **`pi` (surface/skin) vs. `touch`:** Your decision to merge "touch" into "surface/skin" was excellent. It simplifies the lexicon beautifully.

3.  **Spelling and Typos in the Dictionary:**
    *   In the intro, you say "impossible to **earn** perfectly" for Lojban, should be **learn**.
    *   Under `geng`, you have `genggeng` twice. One should probably be deleted.
    *   Under `baibai`, you have it listed twice.
    *   `lailai` is listed twice.
    *   `mengmeng` is listed twice.
    *   `dada` is listed twice.
    *   `dwedwe` is listed twice.
    *   `kaboiboi` is listed twice.
    *   `danidamengkiboi` is listed twice.
    *   `wangwangpwayang` is listed twice.
    *   `nokwekwepe` is listed twice.
    *   `wawa` is listed twice.
    *   `wiwiboi` is listed twice.
    *   `wiwimang` is listed twice.
    *   `wiwitai` is listed twice.
    *   There's a compound `do againstagainst this of that`. The gloss "againstagainst" suggests `genggeng`, so the phrase should be `du genggeng i de a`.
    *   In `se so dwe: tadwemang de aisaka` story, "ayalang" is used for Ireland. This is a loanword that violates the rules. It should be described, e.g., `dalelu so pwayang` (the green country).

#### **IV. Review of Stories and Usage**

The stories are the best part of this document. They show the language is expressive and has a certain charm. Here are some observations based on them:

1.  **`du bi` Construction:**
    *   You use `X du bi Y` for "X is Y." This is consistent.
    *   However, you also have `X du bi so Y` where Y is an adjective (e.g., `i se du bi so da noku du pumeng` - the language is very easy to learn). This is where the grammar needs to be firmed up. Is `so` required? Is `du bi` required?
    *   **Recommendation:** Clarify the rule.
        *   **Option A (Simplest):** Adjectives don't need `du bi`. `i se so da noku` (The language [is] very easy).
        *   **Option B (Explicit):** Always use `du bi`. `i se du bi so da noku`.
        *   The story "Random Coping Chess" has `mina du yau pe de mina o du bi so peli!` (We want our games to all be fun!). This suggests `du bi so [adjective]` is the intended structure. If so, make this explicit in the tutorial.

2.  **Modal Verbs (`dwa`, `nang`, `yau`):**
    *   The structure `[subject] [modal] du [verb]` is clear and well-used (e.g., `i dwa du noswe nau` - he must wash his nose).
    *   The stacking is also good: `yu lailai nang bu du pingpi i` (You still can try to pat him).

3.  **Clarity and Flow:**
    *   The stories are remarkably clear. The logic flows well, and the meaning is almost always discernible from the compounds and context.
    *   The story of Isaac and the flight is a perfect stress test. It handles complex situations, dialogue, and emotions effectively. The compound `tadwemang de aisaka` (the god of Isaac) is a brilliant, culturally-specific concept that emerged naturally from the language's own rulesâ€”this is a sign of a well-designed system.

### **Summary of Key Recommendations:**

1.  **Fix Core Inconsistencies:**
    *   **Split `ba`:** Create a new atom for "please/command."
    *   **Eliminate `u_` words and `kau`:** Replace them with descriptive compounds. Let the system do its job.
    *   **Fix `daga` (dog):** Re-gloss it as `deyago` (follow).

2.  **Clarify Grammatical Rules:**
    *   **De-overload `so`:** Use `de` for relative clauses and a compound for similes.
    *   **Formalize the Passive:** Explain and use the `sa` (experience) passive consistently.
    *   **Clarify Adjective Usage:** State the definitive rule for using adjectives (e.g., `X du bi so [adj]` vs. `X so [adj]`).

3.  **Review and Refine Compounds:**
    *   Go through the dictionary and check for unintuitive compounds (like `dapwaboi` for squirrel) or contradictory ones (like `lobangkoboi` for crab). The goal is not just to have a word, but to have the *most logical and intuitive* compound.
    *   Proofread the dictionary for duplicate entries.

You have created something truly special with Sesowi. It has a strong identity, a clever structure, and the potential to genuinely meet its goals of being simple and universal. These critiques are offered in the spirit of helping you refine an already excellent creation into something even more robust and elegant. Great work
