  * Notes: Merged in "group", the plural marker. The polysemy of "number"="whicth number in a group" and "number"="a quantity" is a little odd, but English has it too.
There is a bit of an ambiguity of big-number = large group or big number, but prolly fine.

"you mean other can you do this or self can you do this?"
Note: In Chinese, 让 means both "allow" and "make" (he made me clean my room). This is simpler (more compressed) but strikes me as a bug in the language. On the other hand, collapsing "allow" and "can" seems more fine...in part because "can" is only intransitive, and "allow" is only transitive.

"sun color" was better, but sun was deprecated. energy-color is OK but then 3 colors start in l*. Yellow starting in "pa-" is good because it mirrors Telugu pasupu, Hindi pila.

  * Notes: has antonym; "before" is an interesting word, because it literally means "in front". Thus "vorhersagen" etc really refer to time stretching in front of you. Therefore, "back" is a less confusing gloss. Note that this could be anti-front, but is seems too fundamental for that.
